  "We provide templates to demonstrate different languages and frameworks within
  Architect. They will help you get started deploying a cloud application on
  Architect with a familiar framework."

### Templates

- [`Django`](https://github.com/architect-templates/django)
- [`Flask`](https://github.com/architect-templates/flask)
- [`NestJS`](https://github.com/architect-templates/nestjs)
- [`Nuxt`](https://github.com/architect-templates/nuxt)
- [`NodeJS`](https://github.com/architect-templates/node-rest-api)
- [`React`](https://github.com/architect-templates/react)

Each template has a component spec file, `architect.yml`, that defines how the
application should be deployed. Instructions on how you can run the application
locally or deploy it remotely to the Architect Cloud are also described. Learn
more about the [architect.yml](/reference/architect-yml) file.
