title: "Component registration"
---

In most scenarios, an Architect component will be registered and deployed with
the same `deploy` command. In cases where a component should be registered but
not immediately deployed, Architect provides the `register` command.

## Registering a component

Registering a component will push a component's configuration and Docker image
to the Architect Cloud. The component will then be ready to be deployed at any
time. To register a component, just run a command similar to the one below which
specifies the path of the Architect component configuration file. If no tag is
specified with the `-t` or `--tag` flag, the tag `latest` will be used.

```sh
architect register ./architect.yml
```

## Tagging a component

Components can be registered with different tags such as 0.0.1, preview-10, or
latest in order to differentiate between versions. Tagging components is
especially useful in cases where different versions of the component should be
deployed to different environments such as a preview environment, staging, or
production. An example of registering with a tag is below.

```sh
architect register ./architect.yml -t 0.0.1
```
