title: Databases
---

<Warning>
  Declarative databases are currently an **alpha** feature. While the feature should be stable, it may
  be changed without prior notice.
</Warning>

Databases represent a common building block in cloud architecture, and Architect makes it easier than
ever for developers to create applications that require databases. Simply declare them as part of your
component and they'll be automatically deployed alongside your applications.

```yaml architect.yml
databases:
  main:
    description: Main storage for my application
    type: postgres:13
```

## Integration

Like services, databases represent persistent runtimes that can be connected to by other applications and
services. You can refer to many of the same fields supported by service interfaces for databases as well.

```yaml
databases:
  main:
    type: postgres:13

services:
  api:
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environment:
      DB_DSN: ${{ databases.main.url }}
```

| key        | description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `url`      | Fully resolvable URL of the database (alias: `connection_string`) |
| `host`     | Hostname of the database |
| `port`     | Port the database is exposed on |
| `protocol` | Protocol the database responds to |
| `username` | Username used to authenticate with the database |
| `password` | Password used to authenticate with the database |
| `database` | The database (e.g. namespace) on the instance to be connected to |

## How databases get deployed

Today, Architect deploys databases by transforming the database definitions into single-interface services.
That means they'll be deployed as containerized applications. This is great for feature-environments,
but not ideal for production.

When going to production, Architect recommends creating your database separately using your favorite
cloud provider. Once your database exists, you can provide the connection string to the environment
to create a [virtual service](/getting-started/external-services) - allowing applications to connect securely
to the existing instance.

## Supported database types

| Type         | Version                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `postgres`   | `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15` |
| `mysql`      | `5`, `8` |
| `mariadb`    | `10` |
