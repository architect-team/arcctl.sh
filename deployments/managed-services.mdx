One of the key features of Architect.io is its dependency graph, which is a representation of the relationships between different services in an application.
The dependency graph is a useful tool for managing complex applications with multiple services and dependencies, and demonstrates how those services work together in an application.

Let's consider an example of a simple web application with a single "hello-world" service.
The dependency graph for this application would have two nodes: one for the "hello-world" service and one for the Traefik gateway.

## Gateway Node (traefik)
The top node is a gateway node that represents Traefik, which is the cluster application used to route traffic to services.
In this example, the gateway node would depend on the "hello-world" service, as it needs to route traffic to it from the internet.

Architect uses Traefik as the reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic to all services.
Traefik is installed as a cluster application upon the creation of the cluster, and is therefore available for use by any environment that is created on the cluster.
Cluster applications, including Traefik, are installed as a set of services within the cluster.
Traefik dynamically discovers services and routes traffic to them based on labels applied automatically by Architect during deployments.

## cert-manager
cert-manager provisions and manages certificates for services which have ingresses defined and will renew certificates automatically when necessary.
Certificate generation will happen automatically when services are deployed, but may take a minute or two to complete.
