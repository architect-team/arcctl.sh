One of the key features of Architect.io is its dependency graph, which is a representation of the relationships between different services in an application.
The dependency graph is a useful tool for managing complex applications with multiple services and dependencies, and demonstrates how those services work together in the application.

Let's consider an example of a simple web application with a single `hello-world` service.
The dependency graph for this application would have two nodes: one for the `hello-world` service and one for the Traefik `gateway`.

## Gateway Node (traefik)
The top node is a gateway node that uses Traefik to route traffic to the service. In this example, the gateway node would depend on the `hello-world` service, as it needs to route traffic to it.

Architect uses Traefik as the reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic to all services.
Traefik is installed as a cluster application upon the creation of the cluster, and is therefore available for use by any environment that is created on the cluster.
Cluster applications, including Traefik, are installed as a set of services within the cluster. 
Traefik dynamically discovers and routes traffic based on the labels applied to the services. 
During deployments, these labels are added to the services to configure both the Traefik and the cert-manager.

## cert-manager
cert-manager works in conjunction with Traefik to handle incoming traffic and manage the certificates for the services.
cert-manager is set up to provision and manage the SSL/TLS certificates for the services, and Traefik uses these certificates to secure communication with the services.
