One of the key features of Architect.io is its dependency graph, which is a visual representation of the relationships between different services in an application.
The dependency graph is a useful tool for managing complex applications with multiple services and dependencies, and demonstrates how those services work together in the application.

Let's consider a example of a simple web application that consists of a single `hello-world` service.
The dependency graph for this application would have two nodes: one for the `hello-world` service and one for the Traefik `gateway`.

The Traefik gateway, is a gateway node that uses Traefik to route traffic to the service. In this example, the gateway node would have a dependency on the `hello-world` service, as it needs to route traffic to it.

Architect uses Traefik as the reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic to all of the services. When a component is deployed, the gateway node is automatically generated on the graph.
Traefik dynamically discovers and route traffic based on the labels applied to the services. These labels are added during the deployments to configure both the Traefik, and the Cert Manager. 

Cert Manager works in conjunction with Traefik to handle incoming traffic and manage the certificates for the services.
Cert Manager is setup to provision and manage the SSL/TLS certificates for the services, and Traefik uses these certificates to secure the communication with the services.
