One of the largest benefits of Architects framework is that provisioning new environments is **always** limited to a single step, `architect deploy`. No matter how complex the application is or how many [dependencies](/components/dependencies) it has, `architect deploy` is able to automatically provision it in a new environment.

What this means is that not only can developers run the stack privately, but the stack can also be provisioned automatically whenever there is a new branch or pull request. This automation is perfect for creating _previews_ of impending code changes so that product managers can review and integration tests can be run end to end.

## Github actions

### Create preview environment

The workflow below can be pasted into a file in your repository in the `.github/workflows` folder to trigger automated preview environments via Architect. These previews will be created whenever a pull request is submitted that targets the master branch. Be sure to set values in Github Secrets for the architect fields: `ARCHITECT_EMAIL` and `ARCHITECT_PAT`. Replace `<account-name>`, `<cluster-name>` with the appropriate values.

<Note>
  `ARCHITECT_PAT` must be a [personal access
  token](/deployments/personal-access-tokens).
</Note>

```yaml
name: Architect Preview

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened

env:
  ARCHITECT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_EMAIL }}
  ARCHITECT_PAT: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_PAT }}
  ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT: <account-name>

jobs:
  deploy_environment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Setup docker build caching
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-runtime@v2.1.0
      - name: Install Architect CLI
        run:  npm install -g @architect-io/cli
      - name: Login to Architect Cloud
        run: architect login
      - name: Convert branch to environment name
        shell: bash
        run: echo "env_name=${GITHUB_HEAD_REF/\//-}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        id: extract_branch
      - name: Create env if not exists
        run: architect environment:create ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }} --cluster <cluster-name>
      - name: Register and deploy component
        run: architect deploy --auto-approve -e ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }} ./architect.yml
      - name: Get ingress routes
        id: get_ingress_routes
        run: echo "ingresses=\"$(architect environment:ingresses ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }})\"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - name: Architect preview information PR comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `Changes are live:
              ${{ steps.get_ingress_routes.outputs.ingresses }}`
            })
```

### Cleaning up the environment

Once your PR is closed, either because it was merged in successfully or closed and rejected, you'll likely want to clean up the environment so that you don't incur continued costs. Github Actions and Architect make this easy, and you can just copy and paste the following workflow into another file in your `.github/workflows` folder:

```yaml
name: Clean up preview environment

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

env:
  ARCHITECT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_EMAIL }}
  ARCHITECT_PAT: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_PAT }}
  ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT: reach-demo

jobs:
  remove_environment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install Architect CLI
        run:  npm install -g @architect-io/cli
      - name: Login to Architect Cloud
        run: architect login
      - name: Convert branch to environment name
        shell: bash
        run: echo "env_name=${GITHUB_HEAD_REF/\//-}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        id: extract_branch
      - name: Remove components from environment
        run: architect destroy -e ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }} --auto-approve
      - name: Remove environment
        run: architect environment:destroy ${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }} --auto-approve
      - name: Architect preview information PR comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `PR environment cleaned up successfully`
            })
```


### Post updates to slack

Depending on the size of your application your PR environment might take a while to first boot up. If you want to receive notifications in slack when the deployments are done, use slacks github action as the last step in your PR workflows. Just replace `<slack-webhook-url>` with one you generate from your slack organization settings:

```yaml
# ...

jobs:
  deploy_environment:
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Post Architect preview information to Slack
        id: slack
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.14.0
        with:
          payload: "{\"preview_env\":\"https://cloud.architect.io/${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT }}/environments/${{ steps.extract_branch.outputs.env_name }}\",\"app_endpoints\":\"${{ steps.get_ingress_routes.outputs.ingresses }}\"}"
        env:
          SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: <slack-webhook-url>
```

## Gitlab CI

### Creating and cleaning up preview environments

This job can be pasted into your `.gitlab-ci.yml` at the root of your repository. You are welcome to change the `stage` to whatever fits your needs to allow you to run
tests before the preview is generated. Please be sure to assign correct values for the variables in the job marked with `<set-this-as-a-CI/CD-variable>` as well as the
ones mentioned in the note below.

This configuration takes advantage of GitLab environments in order to give you better control and visibility into what environments exist and what's deployed to them.
On PR creation, both a GitLab and Architect environment will be created. The component specified in the repository will be registered with the Architect Cloud and
deployed to the environment. When the PR is either merged or closed, the GitLab environment will be automatically deleted and the component deployed to the environment
in the Architect Cloud will be destroyed.

<Note>
  This example assumes that the repo has `ARCHITECT_EMAIL`, `ARCHITECT_PAT`, `ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT`, and `ARCHITECT_CLUSTER` set as CI/CD variables.
</Note>

<Note>
  `ARCHITECT_PAT` must be a [personal access
  token](/deployments/personal-access-tokens).
</Note>

```yaml
stages:
  - preview

variables:
  ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT: <set-this-as-a-CI/CD-variable>
  ARCHITECT_CLUSTER: <set-this-as-a-CI/CD-variable>
  ARCHITECT_ENVIRONMENT: preview-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID
  ARCHITECT_CACHE_DIR: .architect-cache/
