One of the largest benefits of Architects framework is that provisioning new
environments is **always** limited to a single step, `architect deploy`. No
matter how complex the application is or how many
[dependencies](/components/dependencies) it has, `architect deploy` is able to
automatically provision it in a new environment.

What this means is that not only can developers run the stack privately, but the
stack can also be provisioned automatically whenever there is a new branch or
pull request. This automation is perfect for creating _previews_ of impending
code changes so that product managers can review and integration tests can be
run end to end.

## Github Actions

### Create preview environment

The workflow below can be pasted into a file in your repository in the
`.github/workflows` folder to trigger automated preview environments via
Architect. These previews will be created whenever a pull request is submitted
that targets the master branch. Be sure to set values in Github Secrets for the
architect fields: `ARCHITECT_EMAIL` and `ARCHITECT_PASSWORD`. Replace
`<account-name>`, `<cluster-name>`, and `<component-file-path>` with the
appropriate values. With the `--ttl` flag set to 1d, the environment will be
destroyed automatically in a day after creation.

<Warning>
  `ARCHITECT_PASSWORD` must be a [personal access
  token](https://cloud.architect.io/login).

```yaml
name: Architect Preview

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
      - closed

env:
  ARCHITECT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_EMAIL }}
  ARCHITECT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_PASSWORD }}
  ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT: <account-name> # Change to your Architect account name
  CLUSTER_NAME: <cluster-name> # Ex. "architect" to use the managed cluster
  COMPONENT_FILE_PATH: <component-file-path> # Change to the path of your architect.yml
  PREVIEW_TAG: preview-${{ github.event.number }}

jobs:
  architect_create_preview:
    if: github.event.action != 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16"
      - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-runtime@v2 # Exports internal envs for Github Actions. Required for register caching to work.

          env.COMPONENT_FILE_PATH }}

  architect_remove_preview:
    if: github.event.action == 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16"
      - name: Install Architect CLI
        run: npm install -g @architect-io/cli

      - name: Remove preview environment
        run:
          architect environment:destroy ${{ env.PREVIEW_TAG }} --auto-approve -f
```

### Comment on pull request discussion

Use the snippet below in GitHub workflows to automatically create a comment in
the pull request discussion for reviewers to be able to quickly view either the
preview environment or the running appplication created by Architect.

```yaml
---
- name: Architect preview information PR comment
  uses: actions/github-script@v3
  env:
    ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT }}
    COMPONENT: ${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_COMPONENT }}
  with:
    script: |
      const {data: comments} = await github.issues.listComments({
        issue_number: ${{ github.event.number }},
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
      })
      const architectComment = comments.find(comment => comment.body.startsWith('### Architect'));
      if (architectComment) {
        return;
      }
      github.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: ${{ github.event.number }},
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: `### Architect
        Preview environment: [${process.env.ENVIRONMENT}](https://cloud.architect.io/${process.env.ACCOUNT}/environments/${process.env.ENVIRONMENT})
        Running application: [${process.env.COMPONENT}](https://hello.${process.env.ENVIRONMENT}.${process.env.ACCOUNT}.arc.domains)`
      })
```

### Post to Slack

Use the code below in a GitHub workflow to post to a Slack channel on specified
events if collaborators on a feature or issue want to be notified when it is
ready to be reviewed or tested.

```yaml
---
- name: Post Architect preview information to Slack
  id: slack
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.14.0
  with:
    payload:
      '{"preview_env":"https://cloud.architect.io/${{ secrets.ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT
      }}/environments/preview-${{ github.event.number
      }}","app_endpoint":"https://hello.preview-${{ github.event.number }}.${{
      secrets.ARCHITECT_ACCOUNT }}.arc.domains"}'
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### Caching between workflow runs

The Architect CLI can take advantage of caching Docker image layers between
workflow runs. This can dramatically speed up workflows that include registering
a component as one of the steps. This is accomplished by using the Github
Actions cache api directly. The only change is to add the following action
`ghaction-github-runtime` before registering to expose the necessary environment
variables.

## Gitlab CI

This job can be pasted into your `.gitlab-ci.yml` at the root of your
repository. You are welcome to change the `stage` to whatever fits your needs to
allow you to run tests before the preview is generated, and please be sure to
assign correct values for the variables in the job. Additionally, you'll need to
assign values for variables in the below config not prefixed with `$CI_` in your
repository's CI variables configuration so that the architect commands will run
successfully.

This configuration takes advantage of GitLab environments in order to give you
better control and visibility into what environments exist and what's deployed
to them. On PR creation, both a GitLab and Architect environment will be
created. The component specified in the repository will be registered with the
Architect Cloud and deployed to the environment. When the PR is either merged or
closed, the GitLab environment will be automatically deleted and the component
deployed to the environment in the Architect Cloud will be destroyed.

<Warning>
  `ARCHITECT_PASSWORD` must be a [personal access
  token](https://cloud.architect.io/login).
