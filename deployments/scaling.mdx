<Warning>
  This feature is in alpha. While the feature should be stable, it may be
  changed or removed without prior notice. As such we do not recommend using
  this feature in any automated pipelines. During this time we greatly
  appreciate any feedback as we continue to finalize the implementation. You can

</Warning>

Services will sometimes need to be scaled horizontally in order to handle more
traffic, and Architect makes that easy through a few simple methods. Read on to
find out how to quickly scale your services.

<Warning>
  Services cannot be scaled up when using an environment running on the shared
  "architect" cluster; the funtionality is only available for private clusters.
</Warning>

## Scale command

### Scaling up and down

Whether or not services are already running, the `scale` command can be used to
add scaling settings to an environment for a particular service of a component.
If the service is running, the `scale` command will immediately scale the
service running in the environment to the number of replicas specified. This is
especially useful when the number of replicas of a service should differ between
environments.

If the [react demo project](https://github.com/architect-templates/react) was
deployed to an environment called "scaling-example" following the steps in the
[README](https://github.com/architect-templates/react#deploying-to-the-cloud),
all services will be started with a default replica count of 1. If for some
reason the app needs to be scaled up, it can be done with the following command:

```
architect scale app --component react --environment scaling-example --replicas 2
```

You should see a confirmation in green text that scaling was completed and that
the scaling settings for the environment were updated. If you check out the page
for the environment graph on the
[Architect Cloud](https://auth.architect.io/u/login?state=hKFo2SBLOTdBYTdVeHZhN000bUhkWW5OOHNrZTFhZ1Vsc1NKNaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIFRvVkMtU0NaWWotcEVLZzhDOTI1VUs1cVNsTk9DRDVso2NpZNkgbElwVzlmcTlJRlFCQmpUZ2xsaE42RUkwMVRYTWhSVm0)
you'll notice that the number of replicas for the particular service has
increased to two. Scaling back down can be accomplished with a similar command:

```
architect scale app --component react --environment scaling-example --replicas 1
```

### Clearing scaling settings

When the `scale` command is run, it will configure the environment to scale the
service to the specified number of replicas for all future deployments. To clear
the environment's scaling settings for the `app` service, run the command with
the `--clear` flag like so:

```
architect scale app --component react --environment scaling-example --clear
```

Note that using the `--clear` flag will have no effect on the number of
currently-running replicas.

### `replicas` component config property

If a service of a component should have a certain number of replicas across all
environments, the `replicas` field of a service config can be used. Setting the
number of replicas with the `scale` command will override the number of replicas
set in the component config file.

## Autoscaling

You can set scaling rules for CPU and memory for a service. This will allow them
to automatically scale as needed. Below is an example of an architect.yml file
with scaling rules set for max and min replicas, and the amount of memory and
CPU usage for each replica:

```yaml
cpu: 1
    memory: 1GB
    scaling:
      min_replicas: 1
      max_replicas: 3
      metrics:
        memory: 80 # 80%
        cpu: 75 # 75%
```
