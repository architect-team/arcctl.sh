title: How does microservice communication work?
---

Microservices are an important architectural pattern that's gained widespread adoption because of
their many benefits. By decoupling the different components of an application, they make it easy to
scale up or down as needed, especially when combined with cloud architecture. Microservices are
easier to upgrade and maintain since you can deploy each component independently. This makes
microservices a design that helps companies save money while responding to customer requirements
faster.

Since microservices are a distributed architecture, they need to communicate with each other and
with clients. The right protocols help you leverage the power behind this distributed architecture.
The wrong ones will cause problems and negate their many benefits.

Let's look at microservices communications and how to get it right.

## **What are microservices?**

Microservices have been around for a long time. They're often associated with the Agile software
movement and with Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. This makes microservices both
mainstream and difficult to define since they're wrapped into many different concepts.

Let's look at a
[definition from Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#footnote-etymology).

_â€¦ the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite
of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms,
often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and are
independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of
centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages
and use different data storage technologies._

This paragraph packs in several important points about microservices:

1.  They're organized around business capabilities.
2.  Centralized management is diminished in favor of independent deployments and operations and even
    independent programming languages.
3.  They're usually associated with resource-oriented HTTP APIs. (Usually RESTful.)
4.  But they're not tied to a specific technology.

All these points have a direct impact on how microservices talk to each other. If they're organized
by business units, that means different departments must be able to coordinate how the services
communicate. If these groups are going to use different programming tools, they still need to stick
to protocols that work with the tools that other groups are using.

This is one of the reasons RESTful APIs are popular. You can find REST libraries for nearly any
programming language.

### **Who do microservices communicate with?**

Depending on their individual purpose, microservices need to communicate with clients, each other,
and infrastructure such as data stores.

Many microservices are client-facing. This often means they use RESTful APIs to respond to client
requests, but that's not a requirement. Microservices don't have to use REST, and using REST doesn't
make your application a microservice.

Microservices may need to speak to each other, too. Sometimes they use internal services to enrich
responses before sending them to clients. In others, they publish the results of client transactions
to a centralized messaging system for consumption by other services.

Many microservices act as brokers or gateways to data stores, such as relational databases, document
stores, file storage, or legacy services.

## **Microservices communication**

Synchronous and asynchronous are communication patterns used between two or more applications.

### **Synchronous microservices communication**

In microservices and network messaging, synchronous communication uses **blocking** and solicited
semantics: one party makes a request and waits for the other to respond. These request/response
message flows take place over a single connection.

This pattern is common for web applications, where the browser connects to a server, requests a web
page, and then makes new connections and issues new requests based on the contents of the page, like
images, style sheets, and scripts linked in the page. Each resource is a new synchronous request.

The synchronous pattern is common with RESTful APIs, which usually uses synchronous HTTP
communications to GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST requests.

### **Asynchronous microservices communication**

Asynchronous communication uses **non-blocking** and unsolicited semantics. Clients and servers send
messages and don't wait for responses. A single request can elicit multiple responses, and requests
and responses are sent in any order.

![Drawing 2023-02-13 00.46.58.excalidraw.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oQ2XsOTroBJXPv8cDOMfM9ocneEgH2garHMH6pahMp7YpNcJhzMF1M007HVPZjyAAIFTvZ8USNJP9klDJ04IsPQvniBWg9lshuEzIMJ9VcG6QkQbK7il_Ew4XMO9YpEiu6sgclaac4M38lDn9Fad1do)

This pattern is common over messaging systems like AMQP, MQSeries, and JMS. Web browsers and other
web apps may also implement asynchronous messaging over WebSockets.

### **Communication with clients**

While RESTful communications, or Representational State Transfer (REST), is used colloquially to
describe a protocol for messages between clients and servers, it's actually an architecture for
designing how applications communicate.

REST is designed to be lightweight, synchronous, and stateless. When a client requests an object,
they receive the current state. If they want updates, they make an additional request. If they want
to update or alter the object, they send a new synchronous request. When applications use REST
communications, they're constrained to messages and message contents that are designed in advance.

REST is used widely across many web applications and has libraries and tooling for most popular
programming languages.

GraphQL is a query language that's designed to be more efficient and flexible than REST. It allows
applications to create requests at runtime that filter for the entities and fields they need.

GraphQL can also collapse requests for more than one service into a single namespace or graph. This
allows clients to talk to a single endpoint and issue a single query for data that spans more than
one service. It also differs from REST because it is a strongly typed query language.

gRPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) framework developed by Google. It's based on the HTTP/2
protocol and uses Protocol Buffers (`protobufs`) for its underlying data serialization format. So,
clients and servers send and receive binary messages that deserialize into primitive types.

The protocol facilitates high performance, low latency, and low network overhead communication
between web and mobile clients and back-end services. You can use it for bidirectional data streams.
gRPC supports many languages and works with both synchronous and asynchronous programming models.

### **Communication with other services**

Publish-Subscribe (pub/sub) messaging is a peer-to-peer messaging paradigm where applications
connect to message brokers. Subscribers request messages based on topics or expressions that
describe the messages they wish to receive. Publishers send messages to the broker, which delivers
them to the appropriate subscribers.

Engineers commonly use this type of messaging for communications between microservices and the
services they need to perform their jobs. It's very effective for event-driven applications where
one service needs to share something with several counterparts. The message payloads can use
proprietary formats, JSON/YAML, or binary encoding like the `protobuf` format used by gRPC.

gRPC is also useful for communication between server processes. This implementation differs from the
one used between browsers and microservices, as it doesn't use HTTP and supports several programming
languages.

## **Learn more about microservices**

We've looked at how microservices communicate. We discussed synchronous and asynchronous messaging,
the two dominant messaging semantics, and then looked at the most common messaging protocols for
exchanging messages between microservices and their clients. Then we saw how microservices commonly
communicate with each other.
