The demand for speed and agility in software production has driven most industries to transition
from monolithic to microservice architecture. Developers now build applications into segments of
smaller and more manageable pieces. Hence, adding new product lines, functionalities, and
capabilities is easier, yielding accessible and scalable products. However, it's crucial to
prioritize performance testing and monitoring for your microservice applications.

## Introduction to monitoring in microservices

Monitoring is simply a set of practices to understand your microservice environment's performance
and allow you to troubleshoot problems. It helps to identify underlying errors and recognize the
application's overall health. Because of the multiple independently divisible services within your
microservice applications, it becomes tricky to pinpoint the exact cause of errors in the
[production environment](https://www.architect.io/blog/2022-03-21/production-environment-at-different-sizes/)
after an application has been launched.

Monitoring your microservice architecture is critical to ensuring the health of your system. You can
monitor and track the behavior of your microservices by using
[defined metrics](https://www.enov8.com/blog/intelligence-top-5-container-metrics/) and logs to gain
insight into a system's health. Therefore, you can obtain information on the performance of each
service that makes up an application, understand whether API transactions are available and
functioning correctly, identify and isolate transactions and endpoints that are problematic, and
most importantly, enhance the end-user experience.

Monitoring solutions give you the ability to collect logs and other data from your application,
providing value in and of themselves. You may also add observability tools that perform algorithms
on the data collected by these monitoring solutions and give you deeper insight into your system's
performance. Observability provides information about the relationship between the various systems,
whether they are cloud-based or on-premises, and between both internal systems and third-party
applications by aggregating the logs collected from each independent system. Observability is only
possible once monitoring is in place to collect the data on which the analysis is performed. This
blog post focuses on the top monitoring tools available to collect this data.

### Common challenges in monitoring microservices

There are potentially numerous interdependent services that are developed using different
programming languages in a microservice environment. This will eventually increase the number of
individual components you must track. That is to say, runtime failures are likely to occur for
countless reasons (container failures, microservices, etc.), across a broad set of disparate
services, and recovery might be difficult.

## Top five microservice monitoring tools

Platforms and libraries are the two types of microservice monitoring solutions. Some systems may
integrate the two, providing both a data collection platform and a library for instrumenting code.

**Libraries:** In the process of developing an application, libraries are incorporated. Popular
language frameworks, such as Java, .NET, Go, and others, possess libraries that handle logging and
monitoring tasks.

**Platforms:** Monitoring platforms focus on collecting and analyzing data retrieved from the
applications, network platforms, and operating systems.

Here are a few examples of microservice monitoring tools.

tracing tool designed to monitor and troubleshoot complex interactions in a microservice
environment. You may use this monitoring tool to track the progress of a request or transaction as
it moves across many services or through the monitored application.

Instrumentation, data pipeline, back-end storage, and web UI/visualization are the four components
that Jaeger uses to record and track transactions throughout a microservice architecture. Together,
these components can capture transactions into spans and then correlate those
[spans to form a trace](https://www.aspecto.io/blog/jaeger-tracing-the-ultimate-guide/). Jaeger is
suitable for scaling as it supports the implementation of OpenTelemetry.

### 2\. Graphite

[Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) is an open-source, time-series data monitoring tool that tracks

## Introduction to microservice testing

Multiple services are constantly in communication with each other in a robust microservice
application. Because of the flexibility of these applications, team members can modify a service's
features without altering the overall application performance. As the application grows more
extensive, keeping track of each new feature becomes complex. For instance, say you have six team
members working on different areas of your systems and subsystems, deploying new features daily.
Since you're unaware of the changes implemented by other team members, tracking the combined
functionality of numerous services can be tricky. Thus, testing individual microservices as well as
the integration between microservices can help us eliminate these complexities by preventing a
domino effect if an error is encountered in any particular system.

### Common challenges in microservice testing

It can be challenging to isolate the source of a problem because a single user's activity can set
off a chain reaction within numerous microservices that communicate with one another. Some common
errors that result from this include errors generated by a bug within the microservice source code,
alteration in data distributed between microservices, and termination of an operation due to
timeout. Furthermore, because automated testing is becoming more popular for microservices, test
script and autotest authoring abilities are necessary.

### 1\. Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular API testing tool for generating or using APIs. It
uses a graphical user interface to test HTTP requests and get multiple responses, which are then
verified. Postman eliminates the need to set up any frameworks with its user-friendly dashboard.
This tool is commonly used among DevOps engineers and developers for application testing and to
handle the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery or deployment (CD) pipeline.

Postman is an excellent testing tool since it allows users to set up their required environment,
write specs, automate processes, and monitor each step. This powerful testing tool can generate and
validate several HTTP requests (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH). When integrated, it helps developers debug
various tests and uncover bugs efficiently. In addition, Postman converts API to code in multiple
languages like Python and JavaScript, making it easy to use.

### 2\. Apache JMeter

[Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is a 100% Java application with a graphical interface
that uses the Swing graphical API. That is to say, any environment that accepts a Java virtual
machine can run this microservice testing tool (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.). Performance,
functional, and load testing are all done with this open-source tool.

JMeter can analyze and measure application performance and strength under various load types. DevOps
engineers, developers, and other testers can use JMeter for load, performance, spike, and unit
testing. It supports multiple formats for text reporting (HTML, XML, and JSON). JMeter also supports
different processes and protocols like FTP, JDBC, JMS, SOAP, HTTP, etc. It's popular among
developers for its data analysis and visualization features. Similarly, JMeter takes care of web
services, [functional testing](https://www.tricentis.com/learn/functional-testing), generic TCP
connections, JDBC database connections, and OS-native processes.

### 3\. Selenium

[Selenium](https://www.perfecto.io/blog/selenium-latest-version-selenium-releases) is an open-source
software that automates tests for web applications across different platforms and browsers. It
enables you to create test scripts in various languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, and C#.

### 5\. Docker Compose

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool responsible for running multiple
containers as a single service. The containers within these services still interact, although the
services run in isolation. Compose allows you to configure your application's services using a YAML
file. With a single command, you can activate every service in your configuration. Compose operates
in all contexts, including production, staging, development, testing, and continuous integration
workflows.

Compose simplifies the creation and deconstruction of isolated testing environments for your test
suite in a test environment. However, you can create and destroy these environments with a singular
command by specifying the entire environment in a Compose file.

Here are some additional features of Docker Compose:

- It helps with app security. Isolating containers from one another reduces the risk landscape.
- It's a single host deployment, which entails running everything on a single piece of hardware.
- Because it uses YAML scripts, the configuration is quick and straightforward.
- Docker Compose enables high productivity because it shortens the time required to complete
  activities.
