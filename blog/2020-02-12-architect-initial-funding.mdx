Architect – a Boston-based developer platform helping teams build, manage, and deploy cloud
applications – has raised $1.5M in initial funding. The round was co-led by
[NextGen Venture Partners](https://nextgenvp.com/) and
[Comcast Ventures](https://comcastventures.com/).

The Architect team – led by co-founders David Thor and TJ Higgins – aims to build the world’s first
virtual architect to aid engineering teams in creating and managing cloud-native applications. The
platform enables any engineer to deploy even the most complex systems to a variety of cloud
platforms (like Kubernetes or AWS ECS) with the push of a button.

The power of end-to-end provisioning and continuous delivery empowers teams with accelerated
debugging, on-demand environments for integration testing, and better support for cloud migration
and multi-cloud approaches. This freedom to provision unlocks additional engineering efficiency and
automates enormous amounts of error-prone, and often manual labor otherwise performed by high-value
team members.

The concept was inspired by the first-hand management experiences of Architect’s Founder and CEO,
David Thor. After running a private development firm, building the product and engineering team
behind Confirm.io, and subsequently landing at Facebook via Confirm’s acquisition, Thor found his
teams plagued with repeated issues collaborating across cloud services and teams, and provisioning
end-to-end environments. In April 2019, Thor teamed up with long-time friend and fellow engineer, TJ
Higgins, to build a platform to solve their shared problems.
