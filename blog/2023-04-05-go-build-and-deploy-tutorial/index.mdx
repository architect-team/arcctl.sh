[Go](https://go.dev/), also known as Golang, is a popular, statically typed, compiled programming
language designed by Google. It is an easy-to-learn programming language with a C-style syntax and
strong built-in networking and concurrency capabilities. The ecosystem of developers and tools is
vast and constantly growing, making it a great language to write a new application or microservice.

Go has a lot of built-in support for writing a service that can render templates and write to the
database – perfect for a simple CRUD application. Go’s template syntax can be used to create
server-rendered HTML and the built-in `net/http` package provides us with a handy HTTP server that
can be used to route requests to various handlers and return static content.

This example will use these features to create a simple Movie Rating application that stores a
`name` and a `rating` in a database for each movie entry and retrieves existing entries for display.

Architect will be used to deploy the application in the free Kubernetes environment that comes with
[your Architect account](https://cloud.architect.io/signup).

## Pre-reqs

This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge of the Go language and will focus on building out the
various components needed to build our app.

Before running the steps in this tutorial, make sure that you have the following:

1. A local [Git installation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
2. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (make sure it’s running!)
4. A [free Architect account](https://cloud.architect.io/signup)
5. The [Architect CLI](https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli)

Installing Go is not necessary as our server will be running in a container in this example, but it
can optionally be downloaded [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

## Run the `architect init` command

To start off, we will use the `architect init` command to clone the Go starter project and walk
through the code that comprises the Go project. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a clearer
understanding of how to write a simple service in Go that can render templates and interact with a
database.

Run `architect init` from your terminal, and select `go` from the drop-down list:

```bash
$ architect init
? What is the name of your project? my-starter-project
? Please select a framework/language for your project
  Django
  Flask
❯ Go
  Nest
  Nextjs
  Nodejs
  Nuxt
```

When the command completes, `cd` to the `go` directory:

```bash
? What is the name of your project? my-starter-project
? Please select a framework/language for your project Go

## Project walkthrough

Before we deploy this starter project, let’s take a look at the source code.

### Connect to the database using GORM

[GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html) is a fully featured ORM for Go which allows us to create a simple
Item table and run an auto-migration to update our database. We will use this application to store
movie ratings, but since it can store ratings for any item, not just movies, we’ll call the table
`item`.

The database code is located in `server/database.go`, so open that up in your favorite editor to get
started.

### Imports

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
    "gorm.io/driver/postgres"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)
```

To start off, the `fmt`, `log`, and `os` built-in packages are imported in order to format our DSN,
log any errors encountered, and grab environment variables containing our database information,
respectively.

Next, `gorm.io/driver/postgres` is imported because we are connecting to a PostgreSQL database and
need to use GORM’s Postgres driver. `gorm.io/gorm` is imported in order to open a database session
using the PostgreSQL driver.

### Models

The only model we need for this walkthrough is a simple Item struct with Name and Rating fields.
GORM will use this struct to create a item table in the database with name and rating columns.

```go
type Item struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name   string
    Rating uint
}
```

`gorm.Model` is a helpful struct defined by GORM, which includes the fields `ID` (as a primary key),
`CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, and `DeletedAt`. This is a convenient addition to many models and is
included in our `Item` struct as an embedded struct to simplify our code further.

### Database configuration

Finally, we have a simple function that returns a pointer to our database session called
`ConfigureDb`.

```go
func ConfigureDb() *gorm.DB {
    dsn := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s user=%s password=%s dbname=%s port=%s",
        os.Getenv("DB_HOST"), os.Getenv("DB_USER"), os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD"),
        os.Getenv("DB_NAME"), os.Getenv("DB_PORT"))
    db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("Unable to connect to db")
    }
    // Migrate our database to add this table if it's not already present
    db.AutoMigrate(Movie{})
    return db
}
```

Using the GORM postgres driver, `gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &gorm.Config{})` will return a
pointer to the `gorm.DB` database handle, which can be used to query and insert data into the
database.

Before returning this database handle, `db.AutoMigrate(Movie{})` is called to update the database
(if necessary) with a table that maps to the `Item` struct defined above.

You may be wondering where the environment variables like `DB_HOST` are being set – the
configuration of these environment variables is discussed in the deployment section below.

## Write templates with Go

Next, we need a way for users to create new movie ratings and see existing ratings. To do this, we
make use of Go’s template syntax and the built-in `html/template` package to create and parse
templates.

There are two templates in this project: `server/templates/base.tmpl` and
`server/templates/item_rating.tmpl`. This layout is overkill at the moment because only one template
is utilizing the base.tmpl base template. Still, it showcases how a combination of templates can be
used to render various pages in your application.

In the base template, `server/templates/base.tmpl`, the HTML document is set up with a very basic
body that creates blocks overridden by other templates to insert content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <head>
        <title>Golang App</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/styles.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <p align="center" class="logo">
                <a href="//architect.io" target="blank">
                <img
                    src="https://cdn.architect.io/logo/horizontal.png"
                    width="320"
                    alt="Architect Logo"
                />
                </a>
            </p>
            {{ block "rating_form" .}}{{end}}
            {{ block "rating_table" .}}{{end}}
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

This base template declares a couple of different blocks – a `rating_form` block that will house the
movie rating creation form, and a `rating_table` block that will have a table of existing ratings.

In the “Main” template, `server/templates/item_rating.tmpl`, these blocks are defined.

The `rating_form` block has a simple form that will POST to the /item/ endpoint defined in main.go.

```html
{{ define "rating_form" }}
<form action="/item/" method="post">
  <h1>Favorite Pizza</h1>
  <div class="user_inputs">
    <input
      placeholder="Name*"
      type="text"
      id="formName"
      name="name"
      class="form-control"
      value=""
      minlength="1"
      maxlength="80"
      required
    />
    <input
      placeholder="Rating 1-5*"
      type="number"
      id="formRating"
      name="rating"
      class="form-control"
      value=""
      min="1"
      max="5"
      required
    />
  </div>
  <div class="d-grid gap-2">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
{{ end }}
```

The `rating_table` block uses some of Go’s template language features to conditionally display the
table and to loop through and render all existing movie ratings.

```html
{{ define "rating_table" }} {{ if .Items }}
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Rating</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {{ range $item := .Items }}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ $item.Name }}</td>
      <td>{{ $item.Rating }}</td>
    </tr>
    {{ end }}
  </tbody>
</table>
{{ else }}
<p>No entries found</p>
{{ end }} {{ end }}
```

In the `ratings_table` block, Items references an array of Item structs that will be passed in while
rendering this template. If the array is empty, <p>No entries found</p> will be rendered instead of
the table.

`{{ range $item := .Items }} ... {{ end }}` will repeat the block and assign each element in the
`Items` array to `$item`.

```html
<tr>
  <td>{{ $item.Name }}</td>
  <td>{{ $item.Rating }}</td>
</tr>
```

This will be repeated for every movie, creating a table row with a column for the movie name and
rating.

## Serve some static resources

Now that our templates are in place, we need to handle serving static resources. In the base
template, you may have noticed we included a CSS file in the `<head>`:
`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/styles.css">`. `styles.css` is a static
resource served by our application from the route `/static/styles.css`.

To serve these static resources, we make use of Go’s `http.FileServer` from the `http` package. This
`FileServer` will return a handler that serves HTTP requests with the contents of the file system –
perfect for serving static resources like CSS.

In the `main` function of `main.go`, there are a handful of routes that get registered:

```go
// Serves our main template
http.HandleFunc("/", handleRoot(db))
// Serves our static css assets
http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir(STATIC_DIR))))
// Handles POST requests to add new Items to the database for display
http.HandleFunc("/item/", handleCreateItem(db))
```

The other two handlers will be discussed below, but `http.Handle("/static/", ...)` is the route we
use to serve static resources. `http.FileServer(http.Dir(STATIC_DIR))` creates a `FileServer` that
will serve the contents of the directory `STATIC_DIR`, which is defined at the top of the file to be
"static". Finally, `http.StripPrefix("/static/", ...)` is necessary so that `/static/` is stripped
from the route `/static/your-static-resource.css`, and `your-static-resource.css` will be looked up
in the `STATIC_DIR`.

When `/static/styles.css` is referenced now, the `/static/` handler will be used to serve the file
`styles.css` from the static directory.

## Render templates and handle POST requests

The last step to get our app working is to render the `item_rating.tmpl` template to display the
list of movie ratings and handle POST requests to `/item/` when a new rating is submitted.

These two things are accomplished with the other two routes mentioned above.

```go
func main() {
    db := ConfigureDb()
    // Serves our main template
    http.HandleFunc("/", handleRoot(db))
    // ...
}
```

When / is hit, we call the handleRoot function and pass a reference to the configured database so
that movie ratings can be queried. Because HandleFunc expects a function, func(http.ResponseWriter,
\*http.Request), in order to process requests to the specified route, handleRoot returns a function
with this signature. Any request that doesn’t match the other more specific routes will match "/",
and therefore the first thing done is checking if r.URL.Path != "/". If somebody tries navigating to
/foo, our app will return a 404 via the handle404 function.

```go
func handle404(w http.ResponseWriter) {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Not Found")
}
```

This is a simple function that writes the status code 404 to the HTTP response and adds the message
“Not Found” to the body.

If the route is valid, we need to query movie ratings from the database and render our template with
the array of movies it is expecting.

```go
var items []Item
db.Find(&items)
data := struct {
     Items []Item
}{
     Items: items,
}
renderTemplate(w, "item_rating", data)
```

db.Find(&items) uses GORM to find all records matching the given condition and adds those records to
the destination &items, a pointer to an array of movies. In this case, we want all movie ratings, so
no conditions are passed in.

The item_ratings template expects a struct field called Items that contains this array of movie
ratings so that struct is created and passed to the helper function renderTemplate.

```go
func renderTemplate(w http.ResponseWriter, template_name string, data any) {
    // The base template is always included in whatever template we render.
    base_template := fmt.Sprintf("%v/base.tmpl", TEMPLATE_DIR)
    template_to_render := fmt.Sprintf("%v/%v.tmpl", TEMPLATE_DIR, template_name)
    t, err := template.ParseFiles(base_template, template_to_render)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    if err := t.Execute(w, data); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

This function constructs a path to the base template and the template we have passed in, setting
those values to base_template and template_to_render, respectively. Next, the html/template package
has a ParseFiles function that will create a new template that combines the base template with our
template_to_render. Finally, t.Execute(w, data) will use the combined template to apply the template
to the data object containing the array of movie ratings and write the output to the writer (which
is our HTTP response).

At this point, the / route is rendered and displays the list of movie ratings! The last step is
handling the form submission to create new ratings so that the table isn’t eternally empty. The
handler for the /item/ route looks very similar to /:

```go
http.HandleFunc("/item/", handleCreateItem(db))
```

handleCreateItem has a couple of different responsibilities. It first needs to deal with some basic
data validation, and upon successfully validating that the movie rating data is acceptable, it needs
to write the movie rating to the database and redirect the user back to /.

r.ParseForm() will handle parsing the POST body as a form and put the results into r.PostForm for us
to access.

```go
name := r.PostForm.Get("name")
rating := r.PostForm.Get("rating")
if name == "" {
    redirect(w, r, "/")
    return
}
rating_number, err := strconv.Atoi(rating)
if err != nil || rating_number < 1 || rating_number > 5 {
    redirect(w, r, "/")
    return
}
```

If any validation fails, the user is redirected to the input form again. The redirect function is a
simple wrapper around http.Redirect(w, r, path, http.StatusFound) for convenience. The validation,
in this case, is very basic: As long as the movie name is not an empty string and as long as the
rating_number can be parsed as an integer between 1 and 5, the rating is accepted.

```go
db.Create(&Item{Name: name, Rating: uint(rating_number)})
redirect(w, r, "/")
```

After validation passes, GORM’s db. Create is used to add a new row to the items table. An Item
struct is created with the name and rating_number converted to an unsigned integer. Once the rating
is created, users are redirected to /, which will display the rating in the table.

## Deploy the application

At this point, all the code needed for our simple app is ready! All that is left is deployment, so
your friends and family can finally rate movies. The Architect CLI will be used to run this locally
and will also be used to eventually deploy it to the cloud.

In order to use Architect to run this application locally and on a remote Kubernetes cluster, the
repo contains a file called architect.yml. This configuration file looks a lot like a Docker Compose
file – when running architect dev, it will be converted into a docker-compose.yml and will be run
with docker compose. When deploying to the cloud, the architect.yml is used to generate Terraform.

The architect.yml file in this starter project is heavily annotated to describe what each block of
configuration is doing – more information about the architect.yml file and what options are
available can be found in the Architect docs.

### Run locally

Before deploying to a cloud environment, it is always a good idea to first run your application
locally. You can do this using Architect by executing a single command from the top-level directory
of the cloned repository:

```bash
$ architect dev .
```

You’ll see the container build and then start running. The gateway containers that you see manage
incoming network traffic and allow Architect to serve the applications on fixed domains.

```bash
Once the containers are running, they will be accessible via the following URLs:
https://app.localhost.architect.sh:443/ => go-demo--app
http://localhost:443/ => gateway:443
http://localhost:8080/ => gateway:8080
http://localhost:50000/ => go-demo--app:8000
http://localhost:50001/ => go-demo--app-db:5432
```

When the container startup is complete, Architect will serve the Go application at
https://app.localhost.architect.sh:443/, which will open in a tab in your browser automatically. You
can now rate movies!

### Deploy to the cloud

Now that we have tested the application locally, we are ready to deploy it to the cloud. First,
we’ll deploy using AWS native tools. Then we’ll use Architect to deploy the application using a
single command.

#### Use AWS native tooling

You’ll need an EKS cluster for these next steps. If you need help creating a cluster or installing
`kubectl`,
[follow these steps](https://www.architect.io/blog/2023-01-19/kubernetes-cluster-in-aws/).

Before you can deploy the application, you’ll need to build it and push it to a remote registry. To
build the image locally and push it to Docker Hub, run the following command, substituting your
Docker repo name:

```bash
docker build -t YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME/go-app:latest .
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME/go-app:latest
```

Alternatively, you can push a private image to ECR and set up IAM permissions so that you can push
your image from the command line.

Now that your container is available in a remote registry, we’ll need to create a couple of
deployments and services. First, create a deployments.yml file:

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-go-deployment
  namespace: sample-app
  labels:
    app: sample-go
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-go
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-go
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: go-app
          image: YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME/go-app:latest
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8000
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          env:
            - name: PORT
              value: '8000'
            - name: DB_NAME
              value: 'app-db'
            - name: DB_USER
              value: 'architect'
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              value: 'secret'
            - name: DB_HOST
              value: 'postgres'
            - name: DB_PORT
              value: '5432'

          imagePullPolicy: 'IfNotPresent'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_DB
              value: 'app-db'
            - name: POSTGRES_USER
              value: 'architect'
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              value: 'secret'
            - name: PGDATA
              value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/db
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
              name: postgredb
      volumes:
        - name: postgredb
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: postgres-pv-claim
```

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DOCKER_REPO_NAME/go-app:latest` with your Docker repo name! This
deployments.yml will create a few resources – the Go application, a PostgreSQL 12 database, and a
volume for the database to use to store data persistently.

Next, we need to set up some network services so that our Go application can connect to the database
and so we can reach the Go application from outside the cluster. Create a file called
`network_services.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres
  namespace: sample-app
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  selector:
    app: postgres
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: go-app-lb
  namespace: sample-app
  labels:
    app: sample-go
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: sample-go
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
```

And finally, we’ll use kubectl to apply these changes by running:

```bash
kubectl create namespace sample-app
kubectl apply -f deployments.yaml -f network_services.yml
```

In order to access the application, you’ll need the external IP address, which you can find by
running:

```bash
$ kubectl get services --namespace=sample-app
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP
go-app-lb   LoadBalancer   172.20.181.57   <omitted>.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
postgres    ClusterIP   172.20.103.61   <none>
```

If you navigate to the go-app-lb resource’s external IP in your browser, you will see the app
running!

### Use Architect

Architect offers a free cloud where you can deploy your application. You can even integrate
Architect with GitOps to launch the application in a new environment with every pull request.
However, for this post, we are going to show you how to use Architect to deploy to an external EKS
cluster.

#### Login

You’ll need to create a free Architect account for these next steps. Once you’ve created an account,
you can log in with the CLI by running the following command:

```bash
$ architect login
```

This command prompts you to log into your account through the browser, and then your requests made
via the CLI will be authenticated.

#### Setup your cluster environment

Next, you’ll connect your EKS cluster to Architect. For this step, you’ll need the kubeconfig for
your cluster. You can store it in the default location, ./kube/config, or you can pass the location
of the file on the command line. Run the following command to connect your EKS cluster to Architect:

```bash
$ architect cluster:create <cluster-name> --kubeconfig <kubeconfig-file-path>
```

If you have more than one Architect account, a dropdown list of accounts will be displayed.
Architect will also display a list of all the clusters it found in your kubeconfig, so you’ll need
to select the one you wish to connect. When the command completes, the output will look similar to
the following:

```bash
% architect cluster:create aws
? Select an account to register the cluster with <account-name>
? Which kube context points to your cluster? arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:914808004132:cluster/<cluster-name>
Creating the service account... done
Registering cluster with Architect... done
Cluster registered: https://cloud.architect.io/sp-demo/clusters/new?cluster_id=757d4894-0b9e-452c-94c9-d0eeaad280aa
Installing the agent... done
? Would you like to install the requisite networking applications? This is a required step before using Architect with this cluster. More details at the above URL. (Y/n)
```

Now that Architect has access to your EKS cluster, you’ll need to create a new environment. A
cluster environment is similar to a namespace, and enables logical separation of deployed
components.

Run the following command to create an environment, and select your cluster name from the dropdown
list:

```bash
architect environments:create <environment-name>
```

When the command completes, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
% architect environments:create <environment-name>
? Select a cluster <cluster-name>
Registering environment with Architect... done
Environment created: https://cloud.architect.io/<account-name>/environments/<environment-name>
```

#### Deploy

Now that you have connected your cluster and created an environment, you only need to run a single
command to deploy any application. Run the following command from the top-level directory of your
project, and select the environment you just created from the drop-down list:

```bash
% architect deploy .
```

Once you run the command above, you’ll be asked “Would you like to apply?” to confirm the deployment
pipeline. Select Yes to complete the deployment, or feel free to follow the link to the “Pipeline
ready for review” in the Architect UI. When the component has been deployed, your terminal will look
similar to this:

```bash
$ architect deploy .
[ Image building and registration removed for clarity ]
Creating pipelines... done
Pipeline ready for review: https://cloud.architect.io/<account-name>/environments/<environment -name>/pipelines/<pipeline-id>
? Would you like to apply? Yes
go-demo:architect.environment.<environment-name> Deployed
Deploying... done
```

## That's a wrap

At this point, you’ve built an application in Go that can be run locally and deployed to the cloud
with only a handful of commands. You should now understand how to write some simple HTTP endpoints
using Go, how to use Go’s template language to write templates, and how to string it all together to
build a website that can read and write from a database!
