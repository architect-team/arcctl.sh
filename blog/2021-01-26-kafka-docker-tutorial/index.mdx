Apache Kafka is a high-throughput, high-availability, and scalable solution chosen by the world's
top companies for uses such as event streaming, stream processing, log aggregation, and more. Kafka
runs on the platform of your choice, such as Kubernetes or ECS, as a cluster of one or more Kafka
nodes. A Kafka cluster will be initialized with zero or more topics, which you can think of as
message channels or queues. Clients can connect to Kafka to publish messages to topics or to consume
messages from topics the client is subscribed to.

Docker is an application that uses virtualization to run containerized applications on a host
machine. Containerization enables users to build, run, and test applications completely separately
while still allowing them to communicate across a network. Importantly, containerization enables
application portability so that the same application can be run on your local machine, a Kubernetes
cluster, AWS, and more.

Both Kafka and Docker are pretty complex technologies, and it can be difficult to determine where to
get started once you're sure that they're the right fit for the problem you're solving. To keep
things simple, we'll create one producer, one consumer, and one Kafka instance.

## Project dependencies for Kafka and Docker

In this tutorial, we'll start by using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to build,
run, and test locally. We'll also walk through how to use
[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) to deploy our application to the
cloud. Last, we'll walk through how we can use [Architect](https://www.architect.io/) to seamlessly
deploy our application locally and to the cloud using the same configuration. Before getting
started, be sure to have the following dependencies installed locally:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [A Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/signup)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Architect CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@architect-io/cli)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [A Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean or elsewhere](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new)
- [A free Architect account](https://auth.architect.io/u/signup?state=hKFo2SBVa2lpM3VweDFFQTl2N0pCdXhPQ19EeFE5MHp3VGlUbKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIFp1ek51dWNNNUVESGlFN3dtNkFwSzYtbFpyZmlTYkJro2NpZNkgbElwVzlmcTlJRlFCQmpUZ2xsaE42RUkwMVRYTWhSVm0)

As mentioned previously, this part of the tutorial will contain multiple services running on your
local machine. You can use `docker-compose` to run them all at once and stop them all when you're
ready. Let's get going!

## Build the publisher service in Node for Kafka with Docker

You can [clone this repo](https://github.com/architect-community/node-kafka) to access the code used
in this blog post, or you can follow along with the following steps. Start by creating a project
directory with two folders inside it named “subscriber” and “publisher.” These folders will contain
the application code, supporting Node files, and Dockerfiles that will be needed to build the apps
that will communicate with Kafka.

The publisher service will be the one that generates messages that will be published to a Kafka
topic. For simplicity, the service will generate a simple message at an interval of five seconds.
Inside of the “publisher” folder, add a new file called index.js with the following contents:

```js
const kafka = require('kafka-node');
const client = new kafka.KafkaClient({
  kafkaHost:
    process.env.ENVIRONMENT === 'local'
      ? process.env.INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR
      : process.env.EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR,
});
const Producer = kafka.Producer;
const producer = new Producer(client);

producer.on('ready', () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    const payloads = [
      {
        topic: process.env.TOPIC,
        messages: [`${process.env.TOPIC}_message_${Date.now()}`],
      },
    ];

    producer.send(payloads, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      console.log(data);
    });
  }, 5000);
});

producer.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
```

Save and close the index. We'll also need some supporting modules installed to our Docker container
when it's built. Also, in the “publisher” folder, create a `package.json` with the JSON here:

```json
{
  "name": "publisher",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.20.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "kafka-node": "^5.0.0",
    "winston": "^3.8.2"
  }
}
```

Save and close the package.json. Alongside the last two files, we'll need a `package-lock.json`,
which can be created with the following command:

```sh
npm i --package-lock-only
```

The last file to create for the publisher will pull everything together, and that's the Dockerfile.
Create the Dockerfile alongside the other three files that were just created and add the following:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Save and close the file. Line by line, the Dockerfile that was just added to the folder will
instruct the Docker daemon to build the publisher image like so:

- Pull the Docker image `node:12-alpine` as the base container image
- Set the working directory to `/usr/src/app`. Subsequent commands will be run in this folder
- Copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` that were just created into the `/usr/src/app`
  directory
- Run `npm install` to install node modules
- Copy the rest of the files from the directory on the home machine to `/usr/src/app`. Importantly,
  this includes the `index.js`
- Run the command `npm start` in the container. `npm` is already installed on the `node:12-alpine`
  image, and the `start` script is defined in the `package.json`

## Build the subscriber service for Kafka with Docker

The subscriber service will be built very similarly to the publisher service and will consume
messages from the Kafka topic. Messages will be consumed as frequently as they're published, again,
every five seconds in this case. To start, add a file titled `index.js` to the “subscriber” folder
and add the following code:

```js
const kafka = require('kafka-node');
const client = new kafka.KafkaClient({
  kafkaHost:
    process.env.ENVIRONMENT === 'local'
      ? process.env.INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR
      : process.env.EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR,
});
const Consumer = kafka.Consumer;

const consumer = new Consumer(
  client,
  [
    {
      topic: process.env.TOPIC,
      partition: 0,
    },
  ],
  {
    autoCommit: false,
  }
);

consumer.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});

consumer.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
```

Save and close the index. Also, similar to the publisher, we'll need a package.json file like this:

```json
{
  "name": "subscriber",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "Architect.io",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.20.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "kafka-node": "^5.0.0",
    "winston": "^3.8.2"
  }
}
```

Save and close the package.json, then create a package-lock.json using the same command as before:

```sh
npm i --package-lock-only
```

The subscriber needs one extra file that the publisher doesn't, and that's a file we'll call
`wait-for-it.js`. Create the file and add the following:

```js
const kafka = require('kafka-node');
const client = new kafka.KafkaClient({
  kafkaHost:
    process.env.ENVIRONMENT === 'local'
      ? process.env.INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR
      : process.env.EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR,
});
const Admin = kafka.Admin;
const child_process = require('child_process');

const admin = new Admin(client);
const interval_id = setInterval(() => {
  admin.listTopics((err, res) => {
    if (res[1].metadata[process.env.TOPIC]) {
      console.log('Kafka topic created');
      clearInterval(interval_id);
      child_process.execSync('npm start', { stdio: 'inherit' });
    } else {
      console.log('Waiting for Kafka topic to be created');
    }
  });
}, 1000);
```

This file will be used in the Docker container to ensure that the consumer doesn't attempt to
consume messages from the topic before the topic has been created. Each second, it will check
whether the topic exists, and when Kafka has started, and the topic is finally created, the
subscriber will start. Last, create the Dockerfile in the “subscriber” folder with the following
snippet:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

CMD [ "node", "wait-for-it.js" ]
```

The subscriber's Dockerfile is the same as the publisher's, with the one difference noted above. The
command that starts the container uses the `wait-for-it.js` file rather than the index. Save and
close the Dockerfile.

## The docker-compose file for the Kafka stack

The `docker-compose` file is where the publisher, subscriber, Kafka, and
[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) services will be tied together. Zookeeper is a service
that is used to synchronize Kafka nodes within a cluster. Zookeeper deserves a post all of its own,
and because we only need one node in this tutorial I won't be going in-depth on it here. In the root
of the project alongside the “subscriber” and “publisher” folders, create a file called
`docker-compose.yml` and add this configuration:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  zookeeper:
    ports:
      - '50000:2181'
    image: zookeeper:3.5.9
  kafka:
    ports:
      - '50001:9092'
      - '50002:9093'
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: 'zookeeper:2181'
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: 'INTERNAL://:9092'
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: 'INTERNAL://:9092'
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: 'INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT'
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: INTERNAL
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: '1'
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: 'example-topic:1:1'
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: host.docker.internal # change to 172.17.0.1 if running on Ubuntu
    image: 'wurstmeister/kafka:2.13-2.8.1'
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
  publisher:
    depends_on:
      - kafka
    environment:
      TOPIC: example-topic
      ENVIRONMENT: local
      INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR: 'kafka:9092'
    build:
      context: ./publisher
  subscriber:
    depends_on:
      - kafka
    environment:
      TOPIC: example-topic
      ENVIRONMENT: local
      INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR: 'kafka:9092'
    build:
      context: ./subscriber
volumes: {}
```

Note that the `services` block of the `docker-compose` contains four keys under which we define
specific properties for each service. Below is a service-by-service walkthrough of what each
property and its sub-properties are used for.

### Zookeeper

The `ports` property instructs Zookeeper to expose itself to Kafka on port 2181 inside of the Docker
network. Zookeeper is also available to the host machine on port 50000. The `image` property
instructs the Docker daemon to pull the latest version of the image
[zookeeper](https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper).

### Kafka

The `kafka` service block includes configuration that will be passed to Kafka running inside of the
container, among other properties that will enable communication between the Kafka service and other
containers.

- `ports` – Kafka exposes itself on two ports internal to the Docker network, 9092 and 9093. It is
  also exposed to the host machine on ports 50001 and 50002.
- `depends_on` – Kafka depends on Zookeeper to run, so its key is included in the `depends_on` block
  to ensure that Docker will start Zookeeper before Kafka.
- `environment` – Kafka will pick up the environment variables in this block once the container
  starts. All configuration options except for `KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS` will be added to a Kafka broker
  config and applied on startup. The variable `KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS` is used by the Docker image
  itself, not Kafka, to make working with Kafka easier. Topics defined by this variable will be
  created when Kafka starts without any external instructions.
- `image` – This field instructs the Docker daemon to pull version 2.13-2.8.1 of the image
  [wurstmeister/kafka](https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka/) .
- `volumes` – This is a requirement by the Docker image to use the Docker CLI when starting Kafka
  locally.

### Publisher

Most configuration in the `publisher` block specifies how the publisher should communicate with
Kafka. Note that the `depends_on` property ensures that the publisher will start after Kafka.

- `depends_on` – The publisher service naturally depends on Kafka, so it's included in the
  dependency array.
- `environment` – These variables are used by the code in the `index.js` of the publisher.
- `TOPIC` – This is the topic that messages will be published to. Note that it matches the topic
  that will be created by the Kafka container.
- `ENVIRONMENT` – This environment variable determines inside the index file on what port the
  service will communicate with Kafka. The ternary statement that it is used in exists to use the
  same code for both local and remote deployments.
- `INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR` – The publisher will connect to Kafka on this host and port.
- `build` – The context inside tells the Docker daemon where to locate the Dockerfile that describes
  how the service will be built and run, along with supporting code and other files that will be
  used inside of the container.

### Subscriber

Most of the `docker-compose` configuration for the subscriber service is identical to that of the
publisher service. The one difference is that the context tells the Docker daemon to build from the
“subscriber” directory, where its Dockerfile and supporting files were created.

### Run the example stack

Finally, the moment we've all been waiting for, running the services! All that's needed now is to
run the command below from the root directory of the project:

    docker-compose up

That's it! Once all of the services start up and the Kafka topic is created, the output from the
publisher and subscriber services will look like this:

```sh
publisher_1   | \{ 'example-topic': { '0': 0 } }
subscriber_1  | Kafka topic created
subscriber_1  |
subscriber_1  | > @architect-examples/event-subscriber@0.1.0 start /usr/src/app
subscriber_1  | > node index.js
subscriber_1  |
subscriber_1  | {
subscriber_1  |   topic: 'example-topic',
subscriber_1  |   value: 'example-topic_message_1610477237480',
subscriber_1  |   offset: 0,
subscriber_1  |   partition: 0,
subscriber_1  |   highWaterOffset: 1,
subscriber_1  |   key: null
subscriber_1  | }
subscriber_1  | {
subscriber_1  |   topic: 'example-topic',
subscriber_1  |   value: 'example-topic_message_1610477242483',
subscriber_1  |   offset: 1,
subscriber_1  |   partition: 0,
subscriber_1  |   highWaterOffset: 2,
subscriber_1  |   key: null
subscriber_1  | }
publisher_1   | \{ 'example-topic': { '0': 1 } }
```

New messages will continue to be published and consumed until the `docker-compose` process is
stopped by pressing `ctrl/cmd+C` in the same terminal that it was started in.

## Run Kafka in the cloud on Kubernetes

Running Kafka locally can be useful for
[testing and iterating](https://www.waldo.com/mobile-testing/types/automated-unit-testing), but
where it's most useful is, of course, the cloud. This section of the tutorial will guide you through
deploying the same application that was just deployed locally to your Kubernetes cluster. Note that
most services charge some amount of money by default for running a Kubernetes cluster, though
occasionally you can get free credits when you sign up. For the most straightforward setup of a
cluster, you can run your Kubernetes cluster with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
For the cluster to pull the Docker images that you will be building, a
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account will be useful, where you can host multiple free
repositories. The same code and Docker images will be used from the previous part of the tutorial.

### Build and push the images to Docker Hub

For the Kubernetes cluster to pull the Docker images, they'll need to be pushed to a repository in
the cloud where they can be accessed. Docker Hub is the most frequently used cloud-hosted
repository, and the images here will be made public for ease of use in this tutorial. To start, be
sure that you have a Docker Hub account, then enter the following in a terminal:

```sh
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub username (not email) and password when prompted. You should see the message –
`Login Succeeded` – which indicates that you've successfully logged in to Docker Hub in the
terminal. The next step is to push the images that will need to be used in the Kubernetes cluster.
From the root of the project, navigate to the `publisher` directory and build and tag the publisher
service with the following command:

```sh
docker build . -t <your_docker_hub_username>/publisher:latest
```

Your local machine now has a Docker image tagged as `<your_docker_hub_username>/publisher:latest`,
which can be pushed to the cloud. You might have also noticed that the build was faster than the
first time the publisher was built. This is because Docker caches image layers locally, and if you
didn't change anything in the publisher service, it doesn't need to be rebuilt completely. Now, push
the tagged image with the command:

```sh
docker push <your_docker_hub_username>/publisher:latest
```

Your custom image is now hosted publicly on the internet! Navigate to
`https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/<your_docker_hub_username>/publisher` and login if you'd
like to view it. Now, navigate to the `subscriber` folder and do the same for the subscriber service
with two similar commands:

```sh
docker build . -t <your_docker_hub_username>/subscriber:latest
docker push <your_docker_hub_username>/subscriber:latest
```

All of the images needed to run the stack on a Kubernetes cluster should now be available publicly.
Fortunately, Kafka and Zookeeper didn't need to be pushed anywhere, as the images are already
public.

### Deploy your stack to Kubernetes

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster created on Digital Ocean or wherever you prefer, and you've
downloaded the cluster's `kubeconfig` or set your Kubernetes context, you're ready to deploy the
publisher, consumer, Kafka, and Zookeeper. Be sure that the cluster also has the Kubernetes
dashboard installed. On Digital Ocean, the dashboard will be preinstalled.

Deploying to Kubernetes in the next steps will also require the Kubernetes CLI, `kubectl` to be
installed to your local machine. Once the prerequisites are complete, the next steps will be
creating and deploying Kubernetes manifests. These manifests will be for a
[namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/),
[deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), and
[services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). In the root of the
project, create a directory called “kubernetes” and navigate to that directory. For organization,
all manifests will be created here. Start by creating a file called namespace.yml. Within
Kubernetes, the namespace will group all of the resources created in this tutorial.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kafka-example
  labels:
    name: kafka-example
```

Save and close the file. To create the namespace within the Kubernetes cluster, kubectl will be
used. Run the command below:

```sh
kubectl create -f namespace.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

If the namespace was created successfully, the message `namespace/kafka-example created` will be
printed to the console.

Before deployments are created, Kubernetes services are required to allow traffic to the pods that
others depend on. To do this, two services will be created. One will allow traffic to the Kafka pod
on its exposed ports, 9092 and 9093, and the other will allow traffic to the Zookeeper pod on its
exposed port, 2181. These will allow the publisher and subscriber to send traffic to Kafka and Kafka
to send traffic to Zookeeper, respectively. Still in the `k8s` directory, start by creating a file
called `kafka-service.yml` with the following `yml`:

```yml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example-kafka
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:
    app: example-kafka
spec:
  ports:
    - name: external
      protocol: TCP
      port: 9093
      targetPort: 9093
    - name: internal
      protocol: TCP
      port: 9092
      targetPort: 9092
  selector:
    app: example-kafka
  type: ClusterIP
  sessionAffinity: None
```

Create the service in the cluster by running the command below:

```sh
kubectl create -f kafka-service.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

kubectl should confirm that the service has been created. Now, create the other service by first
creating a file called `zookeeper-service.yml`. Add the following contents to that file:

```yml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example-zookeeper
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:
    app: example-zookeeper
spec:
  ports:
    - name: main
      protocol: TCP
      port: 2181
      targetPort: 2181
  selector:
    app: example-zookeeper
  type: ClusterIP
  sessionAffinity: None
```

Create the service within the cluster with the command:

```sh
kubectl create -f zookeeper-service.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

Next, four deployments will need to be created inside the new namespace, one for each service. Start
by creating a file called `zookeeper-deployment.yml` and add the following `yml`:

```yml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: example-zookeeper
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:
    app: example-zookeeper
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-zookeeper
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-zookeeper
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-zookeeper
          image: jplock/zookeeper
          ports:
            - containerPort: 2181
              protocol: TCP
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      restartPolicy: Always
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      enableServiceLinks: true
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
```

Save the contents and run the command below to create the deployment in the kafka-example namespace:

```sh
kubectl create -f zookeeper-deployment.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

When the deployment has been created successfully, `deployment.apps/example-zookeeper created` will
be printed. The next step will be creating and deploying the manifest for Kafka. Create the file
`kafka-deployment.yml` and add:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: example-kafka
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:
    app: example-kafka
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-kafka
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-kafka
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-kafka
          image: 'wurstmeister/kafka:2.13-2.8.1'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9093
              protocol: TCP
            - containerPort: 9092
              protocol: TCP
          env:
            - name: KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS
              value: INTERNAL://:9092,EXTERNAL://example-kafka.kafka-example.svc.cluster.local:9093
            - name: KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS
              value: example-topic:1:1
            - name: KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME
              value: INTERNAL
            - name: KAFKA_LISTENERS
              value: INTERNAL://:9092,EXTERNAL://:9093
            - name: KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP
              value: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
            - name: KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR
              value: '1'
            - name: KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT
              value: example-zookeeper.kafka-example.svc.cluster.local:2181
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      restartPolicy: Always
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      enableServiceLinks: true
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
```

Save and close the file. Similar to the Zookeeper deployment, run the command below in a terminal:

```sh
kubectl create -f kafka-deployment.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

`deployment.apps/example-kafka created` should have been printed to the console. The last two
deployments to be created will be the subscriber and publisher services. Create
`publisher-deployment.yml` with the contents and be sure to replace `<your_docker_hub_username>`
with your own username:

```yml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: example-publisher
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:

Run `kubectl create -f publisher-deployment.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>` to
create the deployment for the publisher and make sure that kubectl prints a message letting you know
that it's been created. The last deployment to create is the subscriber, which will be created in
the same way as the other services. Create the file `subscriber-deployment.yml` and add the
following configuration, being sure to replace `<your_docker_hub_username>`:

```yml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: example-subscriber
  namespace: kafka-example
  labels:
    app: example-subscriber
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-subscriber
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-subscriber
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-subscriber
          image: '<your_docker_hub_username>/subscriber:latest'
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: ENVIRONMENT
              value: prod
            - name: EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR
              value: example-kafka.kafka-example.svc.cluster.local:9093
            - name: TOPIC
              value: example-topic
      restartPolicy: Always
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      enableServiceLinks: true
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
```

For the last of the deployments, create the subscriber by running
`kubectl create -f subscriber-deployment.yml --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>`. If
you now navigate to the Kubernetes dashboard for your cluster, you should see that all four
deployments have been created, which have in turn created four pods. Each pod runs the container
referred to by the `image` field in its respective deployment.

Wait for a success message to print to the console. Now that all required services and deployments
are created feel free to navigate to the Kubernetes dashboard to view the running pods. Navigate to
the running example-subscriber pod and view the logs to see that it's consuming messages from the
topic.

If you're satisfied with your work and want to destroy all of the Kubernetes resources that you just
created, use the following command to clean up:

```sh
kubectl delete namespace kafka-example --kubeconfig=<kubeconfig_file_for_your_cluster>
```

Whew! That was a little complicated and took quite a few commands and files to run. What if
everything that was done could be compressed into a single, short file? What if the entire stack
could be created in Kubernetes with a single command? Continue to find out how easy deploying a
Kafka-centric stack both locally and on Kubernetes can be.

## Run Kafka locally with Architect

The Architect platform can dramatically simplify deployments of any architecture to both local and
cloud environments. Just define a component in a single file representing the services that should
be deployed, and that component can be deployed anywhere. The Kafka example which you just ran
locally can be defined in the following manner as an Architect component:

```yml
name: kafka
homepage: https://github.com/architect-community/node-kafka

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.5.9
    interfaces:
      main: 2181
  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka:2.13-2.8.1
    interfaces:
      internal: 9092
      external: 9093
    environment:
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT:
        ${{ services.zookeeper.interfaces.main.host }}:${{ services.zookeeper.interfaces.main.port
        }}
      KAFKA_LISTENERS:
        INTERNAL://:${{ services.kafka.interfaces.internal.port }},EXTERNAL://:${{
        services.kafka.interfaces.external.port }}
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS:
        INTERNAL://:9092,EXTERNAL://${{ services.kafka.interfaces.external.host }}:${{
        services.kafka.interfaces.external.port }}
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: INTERNAL
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: architect:1:1
    debug:
      volumes:
        docker:
          mount_path: /var/run/docker.sock
          host_path: /var/run/docker.sock
      environment:
        KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: host.docker.internal # change to 172.17.0.1 if running on Ubuntu
        KAFKA_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://:9092
        KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://:9092
        KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
  publisher:
    build:
      context: ./publisher/
    interfaces:
    environment:
      EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR:
        ${{ services.kafka.interfaces.external.host }}:${{ services.kafka.interfaces.external.port
        }}
      TOPIC: architect
      ENVIRONMENT: prod
    debug:
      environment:
        INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR:
          ${{ services.kafka.interfaces.internal.host }}:${{ services.kafka.interfaces.internal.port
          }}
        ENVIRONMENT: local
  subscriber:
    build:
      context: ./subscriber/
    interfaces:
    environment:
      EXTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR:
        ${{ services.kafka.interfaces.external.host }}:${{ services.kafka.interfaces.external.port
        }}
      TOPIC: architect
      ENVIRONMENT: prod
    debug:
      environment:
        INTERNAL_KAFKA_ADDR:
          ${{ services.kafka.interfaces.internal.host }}:${{ services.kafka.interfaces.internal.port
          }}
        ENVIRONMENT: local
```

Copy and paste the `yml` above into a file called “architect.yml” in the project's root directory.
To run the Kafka component locally, run the command below in the project's root directory:

```sh
architect dev architect.yml
```

The same information should be printed to the console as when the stack was run directly with
docker-compose. When you're ready, press Ctrl/Cmd+C to stop the running application. As mentioned
before, an Architect component can be deployed both locally and to any cloud environment. You can
run this stack on Architect's free community cloud by running a few commands from the project's
top-level directory.

First, run the command below to login to your free Architect account from the Architect CLI. A web
browser window will be displayed asking for your credentials.

```sh
architect login
```

Next let's create an environment to run our application in.

```sh
architect environment:create --account=<your_free_architect_account_name> kafka-demo
```

Then run the command below to deploy the stack to the Kubernetes environment that comes with your
free Architect account. Don't forget to replace `<your_free_architect_account_name>` with the name
you used when you created your Architect account.

```sh
architect deploy architect.yml --account <your_free_architect_account_name> --environment kafka-demo
```

Enter "Y" at the next prompt to kick off the deployment. When it completes, you'll see “Deploying…
done” in your terminal. You can login to Architect, select “environments” and then “kafka-demo” to
see the containers you just deployed to Architect's community cloud.

A few clicks, and that's it! The same stack that could be run locally is running in a Kubernetes
cluster in the cloud. If you would like to explore more, feel free to register your own cluster as a
platform with the Architect Cloud!

Finally, to clean up this environment and break down your deployed services, use:

```sh
architect destroy -a <your-account-name> -e kafka-demo
```
