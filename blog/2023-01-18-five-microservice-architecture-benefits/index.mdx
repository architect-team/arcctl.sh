title: 5 key benefits of a microservice architecture

In recent years, microservices have become a central topic in blog posts, conference talks, and
video tutorials. It seems like the whole world is abandoning the monolith and embracing
microservices with open arms. If you haven't been involved with developing a microservice-based
application, you might think, “What's the big deal? What does building software this way get me?”
Here are five of the benefits of a microservice-based software architecture.

## 1. Microservices are more scalable

The microservice architecture itself is a form of software scaling called functional decomposition.
You are scaling your application by deconstructing a monolith into smaller pieces. The real
advantage here is that you can add resources specifically to a resource-intensive task. No longer
will a resource-intensive process in a large application hog the resources from the rest of the
application. If the shipping calculator service begins to take more memory or processing power, you
can increase the memory or processing power of the shipping calculator, no need to increase the
memory or CPU for the entire application, just those processes that need it.

## 2. Microservices are resilient

Any developer who has been around for a while has seen an entire application fail because of a small
error in a small process. In a monolith, the entire application lives or dies together. Developers
can mitigate this by writing properly decoupled applications, but there is a much higher probability
of tiger coupling when all of the code is together in one code base.

Because each microservice is a stand-alone “application”, a fault in the tax calculator service
doesn't have to cause the entire application to fail. Developers can build more fault tolerance into
their applications by seeing and preparing for scenarios where a particular microservice might be
slow or faulty.

## 3. Microservices make software easy-to-understand

Because each microservice is its own “application”, it makes it easier for a new developer to get
their head around the things they'll be working on every day. Understanding those boundaries is very
clear-cut when each boundary is an ACTUAL application boundary and not just a theoretical boundary
between sections of a more extensive application.

A microservice approach may also be easier to organize development teams around. A small group of
developers tasked with developing and maintaining a small microservice can help with lowering
production bugs and speeding up the delivery of new features.

## 4. Microservices make change easier

Since each microservice is completely independent and decoupled from the other services, changing a
service is much less likely to have widespread effects. This means if you find a better way to do
something or a better tool to use for a particular service, you can make those changes without
worrying about whether that code is used by something else in the overall system.

This also means that you are not locked into a particular vendor. If the team writing the shipping
service finds a better provider of shipping rates, they can just rework the service to use the new
provider without worrying whether something else in the system might break. The team could even
decide that a completely different programming language will perform better for the shipping
service!

## 5. Microservices can be deployed individually

Another benefit of a microservice architecture is the ability to deploy each microservice
separately. Deploying an entire monolith can be scary, particularly in older code bases. We've all
been in those all-day meetings on deployment day. Everyone with their laptops ready to fix bugs on
the fly. It's especially painful if there are no changes to the section of the application that your
team is working on. You'd almost wish you could just deploy _part_ of the application. With a
microservice-based architecture, that's exactly what you can do. Since each service is a stand-alone
application, you only need to deploy those services with changes. Making it less likely to have
deployment problems at the service level.

This has one drawback: if you need to deploy the entire application, managing the dependencies
between services can be a challenge, but [Architect](https://architect.io) can handle all those
dependencies for you. When you use Architect to deploy microservice applications, Architect handles
all the dependencies and makes sure that dependent services are deployed before the services that
depend on them. So you can deploy all of the services of an application without worrying about
whether the database service is up and responsive before deploying the inventory service that will
be querying that database. Not to mention handling rollbacks, easy setup of development and testing
environments, and security for secrets and service communication.
