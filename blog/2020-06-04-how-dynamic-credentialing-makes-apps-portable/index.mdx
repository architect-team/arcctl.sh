In my last post we talked about
[how to leverage secret managers to safely store and cycle application credentials](/blog/2020/05/28/using-hashicorp-vault-to-enable-credential-cycling)
in production. In this post we're going to take the concept of credential cycling a step further to
streamline the ability for an app or service to be deployed to parallel environments through dynamic
credentialing.

Allowing apps to be deployed without manual credential generation is critical to making it portable
and deployable by anyone - an important principal that enables peer developers to run and integrate
with your application in their own private sandboxing or integration tests. In this tutorial, we'll
describe what dynamic credentialing is and apply it to a practical use-case - integration with a
hosted service, Auth0.
