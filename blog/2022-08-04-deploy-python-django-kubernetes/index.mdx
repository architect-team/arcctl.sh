Web applications are a crucial part of the global digital landscape. Source code hosting and version
control, container and cloud technology, and more have pushed application development to great
heights. Web applications are now faster, lighter, more stable, and easier to build and manage.

Using source code hosting and version control offered by platforms like GitHub and BitBucket allows
developers to collaborate easily anywhere in the world. These solutions provide a seamless
opportunity to work on the same project or code simultaneously.

## Kubernetes

Container technology such as Docker enables developers to build applications, package the
applications into containers, and run the containers on different platforms and environments. A
container is a “build once, run anywhere” concept. When a team or organization has many containers
to manage in a system, they use container orchestrators like
[Kubernetes](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-kubernetes) to deploy, run, and manage them with
automation. Kubernetes is an open-source project that started in-house at Google and is the most
popular container orchestration platform today. With Kubernetes, you can set up, run, manage,
maintain, and scale containerized applications with ease.

## Django

Django is an open-source web development framework prevalent in the Python ecosystem. It favors the
rapid building of scalable and secure web applications. It powers some popular platforms like
Instagram, DropBox, and Spotify. Django's modular format enables the speedy development of reusable
components. It works with the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture to help separate data and
business logic.

## Architect

Architect is a cloud-native platform that enables you to rapidly deploy your projects with
Kubernetes while providing continuous delivery and security. CI/CD provided by
[Architect](https://www.architect.io/) and other CI/CD tools help automate the processes involved in
deploying and releasing software. Automation helps to ship out applications to users faster and more
frequently. This article shows you how to set up Architect to deploy a Django application with
Kubernetes.

## Deploy Django on Kubernetes

This section provides a hands-on, step-by-step guide accompanied by code to deploy your Django web
application to a Kubernetes cluster using Architect.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need:

- An Architect account. You can [create an Architect account](https://cloud.architect.io/signup/)
  for free if you don't have one already
- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- The Architect CLI. See the
  [installation guide](https://docs.architect.io/getting-started/introduction#install-the-cli) for
  instructions
- A Kubernetes cluster running in a public cloud such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/),
  [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/#overview)

## Components, clusters, and environments

An Architect component defines the services of your application stack that you want to be deployed
together, for example, an API and a database. Using the Architect CLI, you can register your
component locally or in the Architect cloud.

You can add your own Kubernetes cluster from a public cloud provider or use the one provided by the
Architect cloud.

Environments are distinct entities where you deploy a component on a cluster. You can create free
environments on the Architect cloud.

### The architect.yml file

This tutorial uses the [Django starter project](https://github.com/architect-templates/django) built
by [Architect](https://www.architect.io/), which is hosted on GitHub and available in the Architect
UI. There are also starter projects for Flask, Nuxt, React, and other frameworks. Each project
contains an `architect.yml` file in the root-level directory. This is a mandatory file containing
configuration specifications necessary to use Architect to deploy your application. The file for the
Django starter project includes the Django project secrets, database configuration settings,
Kubernetes ingress settings, and Django-specific settings.

The configuration is defined in a declarative manner, utilizing service discovery, so your component
can be built once and promoted all the way to production with no code or configuration changes.

### Create a Django component

Follow these steps to create a new component using the Architect UI.

1. Navigate to the **Component** menu on your dashboard, as shown below. Click **Try It Out**

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/try-it-out-2.png)

2. Click **Use a starter project**

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/create-a-component-2.png)

3. Click on the **django** starter project

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/django-starter-project.png)

4. Select **Github** as the Git provider for your project

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/github.png)

5. Architect requests access to your GitHub account so that it can create a new repository to store
   a clone of the starter project you selected. Click the **Authorize architect-team** button to
   grant access. You may be asked to confirm your password during this process.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pic4.png)

6. Architect then asks for the GitHub organization where you want the project to reside. The
   drop-down box contains your personal account and any GitHub organizations to which you belong.
   Select the GitHub account or organization you wish to use.

Architect also asks you to name your new repository. Name the repository **django-start**, and
select the **Private** checkbox to keep the repository private on GitHub. Then, click **Next**.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/deploy-your-first-application-2.png)

7. At this point, Architect clones the Django starter project in the GitHub account you selected. It
   might take a couple of minutes to complete.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cloning-starter-project-1.png)

9. Upon successfully creating the project, your dashboard should look like the following screenshot:

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/project-setup-complete.png)

10. You should now have a new repository in your selected GitHub account that you can register as an
    Architect component and deploy.

### Register your Kubernetes cluster

Before you can deploy to your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to provide Architect with the
configuration details. Since connecting a cluster involves your `kubeconfig`, you'll use the
Architect CLI to connect your cluster so you never have to upload sensitive connection information
to Architect.

The CLI will look for your Kubernetes config file in `~/.kube/config`, or you can use the
`--kubeconfig` flag and pass the full path to your file if it resides elsewhere.

Run the following command to connect your Kubernetes cluster to Architect, selecting the appropriate
account and cluster:

```sh
architect cluster:create <cluster-name>
```

### Create an environment

Now that you've connected your cluster, you're ready to create an environment, an isolated entity on
a cluster for deploying code, by running the following command and selecting your cluster from the
dropdown list:

```sh
architect environments:create my-first-environment
```

### Deploy the application

Now that you have connected your Kubernetes cluster and created a new environment, you can deploy
the application, which is packaged as an Architect component.

1\. Go to the **Components** menu on your dashboard and click the newly created component,
**django-start**.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/components-1.png)

2\. This page displays the dependencies, services, interfaces, and secrets this component uses.
Click **Deploy** in the upper-right corner.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/usage-1.png)

3\. Select the **test** environment you created earlier for the deployment.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/select-an-environment-1-1.png)

4\. Skip the **Expose Interfaces** section unless you have preconfigured DNS records. Leave the
**Secrets** area empty to maintain the default values specified in your Django project's
`architect.yml` file. Click **Review Changes**, which takes you to the Pipeline approval page.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/configure-the-component-1.png)

5\. The Pipeline approval page looks like the screenshot below. It shows the gateway Architect
creates to serve your application using custom URLs. It also shows the services to deploy, including
the Django application and its Postgres database. Click **Approve** in the top-right corner to
proceed.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pipeline-approve-2.png)

7\. Architect displays the Pipeline Status page, which gives you an overview of the state of each
deployment step.

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pipeline-status-3.png)

8\. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete. Click the **Live** link in the left-hand nav
for the **test** environment. You should see the completed pipeline, as shown in the screenshot
below:

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/live.png)

You can click on the **app** or **app-db** component and view any warnings that were encountered
during deployment. Under **URLs and certificates**, you'll find a URL where you can access your
running application. You can also find this by clicking on the **gateway** icon.

Click on the URL now to launch the application in your web browser. You should see the screenshot
below:

![](https://www.architect.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/django-app-running.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your Django application to a Kubernetes cluster with
Architect.
