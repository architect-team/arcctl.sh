I'm thrilled to be able to share that our team here at Architect.io has closed $5M in seed round
funding, led by Next Coast Ventures and including Abstraction Capital, Spike Ventures, angel
investors Jean Sini, JJ Fliegelman, Chris Nguyen, and Marc Chenn, and returning investors NextGen
Venture Partners and Comcast Ventures. This round of investment brings Architect's total funding to
$6.5M.

Investment in developer relations and other critical go-to-market functions in the face of
increasing demand, as well as a significant increase in engineering resources to achieve even
greater development velocity, are two of the company's key global growth initiatives that will be
supported by the funds raised in this round.

**There has been a groundswell of innovation across cloud tooling in recent years, but that love has
yet to yield an experience suitable for developers to simply create and deploy cloud-native apps and
APIs.** Architect was designed with a developer-first philosophy in mind, making it as simple as
possible for developers to take advantage of best-in-class cloud architecture without having to
worry about the underlying infrastructure. Our continuous delivery platform empowers developers to
create production-grade, cloud applications like never before. This architecture-as-code framework
brings dependency management to cloud applications and provides the best of infrastructure-as-code
in a language designed for developers. It's a powerful combination that enables developers to create
and integrate cloud applications, provision new end-to-end environments, and enrich deployments with
best-in-breed cloud security.

Our goal with Architect is to simplify the lives of engineers building and managing cloud-native
applications by integrating a wide range of production-grade tools. Today, with Architect.io and a
single deploy command, any developer can deploy any service, thus allowing them to create local or
private development environments without having to understand each dependency in detail. The same
deploy command can be used in a CI pipeline to auto-provision environments on commit or review.
Developers can easily share live URLs with managers, reviewers, and testers via GitOps processes.
After they're done, dismantling is simple.

Worried about security and stability? Our platform examines dependencies to determine what to
deliver. Like any infrastructure-as-code solution, the platform can automatically show operators the
complete breadth of modifications required. Architect automatically adds strong network controls to
limit network traffic. It's free since each component knows its own dependencies!

> We use Architect every day to streamline every step of our own development process. It allows our
> engineers to write, test, and release their code – making them entirely self-sufficient. With this
> round of funding, we're excited to invest in our internal engineering team so we can continue to
> expand Architect's feature set and enable our customers to focus on their business – not
> architecture.

> TJ Higgins, Co-Founder/CTO, Architect.io

> For many organizations, navigating the evolving cloud landscape and establishing true continuous
> delivery remains a complex and intimidating process. With Architect.io, developers can go beyond
> just continuous delivery and access everything they need to build, test, and release cloud
> software, reducing that complexity and creating efficiency across engineering teams. Instead of
> forcing developers to learn infrastructure, their infrastructure learns from them.
