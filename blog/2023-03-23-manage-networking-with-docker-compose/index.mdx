title: Manage networking with Docker Compose
author: Eric Goebelbecker

Docker is a powerful tool for distributing, running, and managing applications. But complex
applications often need more than one container, and need a way for them to communicate. This
ability is essential for distributed applications. Fortunately, Docker Compose makes this
information exchange simple with robust and flexible tools for managing networking.

Let's look at what you can do with Docker Compose networking.

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you
to create an application with multiple Docker containers, networks, and volumes with a simple
configuration that can start and stop an application with a single command.

You define your application with a YAML domain-specific language (DSL) that's an intuitive interface
for defining and configuring applications, volumes, and networks. It also has tools to build Docker
images as part of application startup.

Here's a sample file from the
[Docker Compose network documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/)

```yml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
  db:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - '8001:5432'
```

This file defines two **services**:

- **web** is a container Compose builds from a Dockerfile. It looks for in the working directory
  that the user runs it from.
- **db** is a PostgreSQL data server created from the **postgres** Docker image.

Since the configuration doesn't specify a custom network, Compose creates one for the containers to
share. Let's take a close look at that.

### How does Docker Compose networking work?

Docker Compose's default approach to networking is a default network that all the containers in the
application share. They join the network and can locate each other by service name. This is one of
the features that makes Compose so easy to use, since getting containers to connect to each manually
can be a lot of work.

Compose also manages how external programs connect to the containers in your application. Let's look
more closely at the sample Compose file above.

```yml
db:
  image: postgres
  ports:
    - '8001:5432'
```

The **db** service has a **ports** entry that tells Compose to allow external access via port 8001
on the host. When an application connects to **HOST_PORT** 8001 on the host, Docker will route them
to **CONTAINER_PORT** 5432 on the database container.

This **HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT** syntax is the same as the command line docker syntax.

```sh
$ docker run -p 8001:5432 postgres
```

It's worth reiterating that Compose makes it possible for the containers to reach each other by
name. In the example, **web** and **db** are valid host names that resolve to the internal IP
address of the two containers. So, the **web** service can connect to **db** with a connection
string of postgres://db:5432. So, Docker can assign IP addresses at runtime while you configure your
applications using names.

Docker Compose networking has access to all of Docker's networking features. So, you can create
additional networks and load custom or standard Docker network drivers.

Let's use an example to introduce a few advanced concepts.

## Docker Compose networking example

Let's go over a Docker Compose example from
[Docker's Awesome Compose repository.](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) You'll need a host
with Docker installed. Recent versions of Docker Desktop come with Compose built-in. I'll be showing
shell sessions from Linux, but everything works the same on macOS and Windows with WSL.

We'll use the
[nginx-flask-mysql](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/nginx-flask-mysql)
project. Check out the project from GitHub so you can follow the example.

This app defines two custom networks at the bottom of the file: **backnet** and **frontnet**.

```yml
networks:
  backnet:
  frontnet:
```

All you need to define two custom networks are names. Compose takes care of allocating address space
for you.

The application has three services:

The **db** service is a MariaDB server. The service is configured with:

- A health check script that pings it every three seconds and restarts it as needed.
- A volume named **db-data** that it uses for its relational tables, so its data is persistent
  across application restarts.
- One network connection to the **backnet** network, where it **exposes** two ports. We'll cover
  what expose means below.

This service does not have a connection to **frontnet**.

```yml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10-focal
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test:
        [
          'CMD-SHELL',
          'mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 --password="$$(cat /run/secrets/db-password)" --silent',
        ]
      interval: 3s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
    secrets:
      - db-password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - backnet
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=example
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    expose:
      - 3306
      - 33060
```

The **backend** service is a Python app Compose builds on startup from files in the backend
subdirectory. It has connections to both networks and is **forwarding** port 8000 to the host
network.

```yml
backend:
  build:
    context: backend
    target: builder
  restart: always
  secrets:
    - db-password
  ports:
    - 8000:8000
  networks:
    - backnet
    - frontnet
  depends_on:
    db:
      condition: service_healthy
```

**Proxy** is an Nginx container Compose builds on startup from the proxy subdirectory. It's
forwarding port 80. It has an Nginx configuration that forwards HTTP requests on port 80 to port
8000 on the **backend** service.

```yml
proxy:
  build: proxy
  restart: always
  ports:
    - 80:80
  depends_on:
    - backend
  networks:
    - frontnet
```

This application uses the two custom networks to isolate the network traffic between the database
and web application from the host network and load balancer. But, it could be better. Let's see why,
and how to fix it.

Let's run this application and see how the networking looks at runtime.

The configuration is ready to run on any host with Docker installed. Move into the
**awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql** directory and run **docker compose up -d.**

```sh
~/src/awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql$ docker compose up -d
[+] Running 5/5
 ⠿ Network nginx-flask-mysql_backnet      Created                                         0.1s
 ⠿ Network nginx-flask-mysql_frontnet     Created                                         0.1s

```

**Docker ps** tells us a lot about the networking in this application:

```sh
~/src/awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS                                       NAMES

```

We can drill down a bit further with **docker inspect**.

This command inspects a container and filters for the network settings.

Pipe the output to [**jq**](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for pretty printing.

```json
~/src/awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql$ docker inspect --format='{{json .NetworkSettings}}' nginx-flask-mysql-backend|jq

    }
  }
}
```

The **Networks** section shows that **backend** is connected to two networks.

If you look back to **docker ps**, you can see that the **proxy** and **backend** services are
reachable via **0.0.0.0:80** and **0.0.0.0:8000** respectively. **Db**, however, is not forwarding
its two ports.

We can confirm that port 80 is reachable with a web browser:

![port80.png](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sUI1SVBReP4p3ww7hACq45QHeMJ5rCbLxVqlPemm9MQz5CvbOprKHxknoeuOmhrBiygWQT3t3ugWoSoy3qUMec56K09_y6mPdvIT4S96-m9ppK8aCWZpOim09s5GZdQul1GKjYnl1JO9zy9WkDPpCBU)

So is port 8000:

![port8000.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3lvnKbowZ3Ovt_jemc5ZCfUBHacaJ9ySngEXYNsJkXa2HWZTi2ubu4Pyt4FU_5ehKGtRl71G_-_eiVnmbcwS8zAT0FmiU0Zer8J6LBWMmifcifEkZcMRzEMizgf310pAWtU3ZLj7bQ8LiAptWDCPNnk)

That doesn't make sense. Why bother running a proxy if users can reach the application with a direct
connection?

Let's fix that. Open the compose file and edit the service definition for **backend.** Change the
**ports** keyword to **expose** and remove the port mappings.

```yml
backend:
  build:
    context: backend
    target: builder
  restart: always
  secrets:
    - db-password
  expose:
    - 8000
  networks:
    - backnet
    - frontnet
  depends_on:
    db:
      condition: service_healthy
```

Run **docker compose up -d** again.

```sh
~/src/awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql$ docker compose up -d
[+] Running 3/3
 ⠿ Container nginx-flask-mysql-db-1       Healthy                                           1.8s
 ⠿ Container nginx-flask-mysql-backend-1  Started                                           2.4s
 ⠿ Container nginx-flask-mysql-proxy-1    Started
```

Now, **docker ps** tells a different story.

```sh
~/src/awesome-compose/nginx-flask-mysql$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                               NAMES

02f065db02d1   nginx-flask-mysql-backend   "flask run"              6 minutes ago    Up 6 minutes              8000/tcp                           nginx-flask-mysql-backend-1

```

You can verify this by pointing a browser at [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) again.

In this post, we discussed how Docker Compose networking works, and how it makes it easy to create
distributed applications. Then, we used a sample application to demonstrate how port forwarding and
multiple networks operate in a Docker Compose environment.

Architect has tools to make building and deploying containerized applications easier than Docker
Compose. We even have tools for importing Compose configuration into our continuous deployment
environment. [Get started](https://cloud.architect.io/signup) today!
