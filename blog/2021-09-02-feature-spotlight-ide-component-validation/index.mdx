title: 'Feature Spotlight: Validating component schemas in your IDE'
---

We're excited today to announce improvements in our tooling for validating Component files, which
includes JSON Schema Store support as well as a new
[`validate` command for the CLI](https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli#architect-validate-configs_or_components)!

## JSON Schema Store Support

Your editor can automatically show reference docs and validate your architect component files,
giving a more streamlined developer experience while reducing context switching. There is varying
support for the JSON Schema Store across editors, so if your editor doesn't have built-in support
you may need to download an extension.

### IntelliJ by JetBrains

IntelliJ has built-in support for JSON Schema Store, but is disabled by default and needs to be
manually enabled. If you haven't already enabled this feature, you can do so by following the
[IntelliJ JSON documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas).

### VSCode by Microsoft

The
[YAML extension by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
for VSCode provides great support for the JSON schema store by automatically fetching schema from
the store and providing validation tooltips for any matching yaml files. If you prefer to avoid
extensions, VSCode does have built-in support for the schema store, but
[requires some manual configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_mapping-in-the-json).

This image is an example of the json schema being used to validate my architect file in VSCode. At
the top it shows which schema is used for validating the file, and is highlighting a mistake I've
made in my cpu setting in the service debug block.

### Component filename patterns

The schema applies to all `architect.yml` and `*.architect.yml` files, so most of your component
files will be validated by the schema automatically. Component files with names other than
`architect.yml` will need to be renamed for the schema validations to be applied by your editor.

For example you might have two components for a repo named as follows:

    architect.yml
    architect-worker.yml

The first architect file will receive validation as expected, but the second won't. This can be
remedied by renaming it to match the pattern `*.architect.yml`:

    architect.yml
    worker.architect.yml

## Updated CLI Validation

The `validate` command has been added to the CLI for running validations locally. Prior to this,
validations were run as part of the `register` command, but that wasn't helpful in cases where you
wanted to check your work without pushing the component to Architect.

The following example shows the Architect CLI catching a mistake I've made in my component file. The
new validation messages show exactly where the problem is in the file and what needs to be fixed.

Once the issue is resolved, validation will confirm that the file is structured properly and the
component can be registered.
