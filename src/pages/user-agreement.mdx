AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT IT.

2. LICENSE AND SUPPORT SERVICES.
   1. License and Access Rights to the SaaS Service. Architect.io will host the SaaS Service and
      will make the SaaS Service available to Customer during the Subscription Term(s), subject to
      the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The SaaS Service is offered to Customer at no
      cost, unless customer has selected a paid version of the Software. Customer’s access and usage
      of the SaaS Service may not exceed the typical and customary utilization of such service, as
      contemplated by Architect.io in its sole discretion (including, but not limited to,
      creating/deleting an excessive number of workspaces, excessive creation/deletion of accounts,
      and any non-standard usage of compute resources), and may not interfere with other users’
      utilization of the SaaS Service. Architect.io may update the content, features, functionality,
      and user interface of the SaaS Service from time to time in its sole discretion, and may
      discontinue or suspend all or any portion of the SaaS Service at any time in its sole
      discretion, including during a Subscription Term; provided, that Architect.io will give
      Customer at least fifteen (15) days’ advance notice before discontinuing the SaaS Service or
      materially decreasing the functionality of the SaaS Service during the Subscription Term.
      Architect.io grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, nontransferable
      (except as specifically permitted in this Agreement) right to access and use the SaaS Service
      and its Documentation during the Subscription Term, solely for Customer’s internal business
      purposes. Customer may permit its Affiliates to use and access the SaaS Service and
      Documentation in accordance with this Agreement, but Customer will be responsible for the
      compliance of all Affiliates with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the SaaS Service
      is available only on a hosted basis, and Customer will not independently possess, run, or
      install the SaaS Service.
   2. Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Customer will not and
      will not permit any third party to: (a) sublicense, sell, transfer, assign, distribute or
      otherwise grant or enable access to the SaaS Service in a manner that allows anyone to access
      or use the SaaS Service without an Authorized User subscription, or to commercially exploit
      the SaaS Service; (b) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the SaaS Service; (c)
      reverse engineer or decompile the SaaS Service (except to the extent permitted by applicable
      law and only if Architect.io fails to provide permitted interface information within a
      reasonable period of time after Customer’s written request); (d) copy any features, functions
      or graphics of the SaaS Service; (e) allow Authorized User subscriptions to be shared or used
      by more than one individual Authorized User (except that Authorized User subscriptions may be
      reassigned to new Authorized Users replacing individuals who no longer use the SaaS Service
      for any purpose, whether by termination of employment or other change in job status or
      function); or (f) access to or use of the SaaS Service: (i) to send or store infringing,
      obscene, threatening, or otherwise unlawful material, including material violative of
      third-party privacy rights; (ii) in violation of applicable laws; (iii) to send or store
      material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code,
      files, scripts, or agents; (iv) in a manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or
      performance of the SaaS Service (or the data contained therein); (v) to gain unauthorized
      access to the SaaS Service (including unauthorized features and functionality) or its related
      systems or networks; (vi) Circumvent defined limits on an account in an unauthorized manner;
      (vii) Abuse referrals, promotions or credits to get more features than paid for; or (viii)
      Access, search, or create accounts for the SaaS Service by any means other than Architect.io’s
      publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping” or creating accounts in bulk).
   3. Support Services. During the Subscription Term, Architect.io will provide limited email
      support for the SaaS Service, which Customer may request by emailing Architect.io at
      support@architect.io. Customer acknowledges that Support Services do not include support for
      any open source versions of Architect, and Customer agrees to request support only for the
      SaaS Service licensed under this Agreement.
   4. Usage Limits. Use of the SaaS Service is subject to any usage limits, which may include
      limitations on features and functionality, that are set forth on the Architect.io web page
      where Customer registered for the SaaS Service. If Customer exceeds any such limits, Customer
      will promptly notify Architect.io and work with Architect.io to promptly change its usage to
      comply with the limits. Architect.io may periodically verify that Customer’s use of the SaaS
      Service is within the applicable usage limits, and Customer will promptly and accurately
      certify and/or provide evidence of Customer’s compliance with the applicable usage limits as
      may be requested by Architect.io from time to time.
3. Customer Responsibilities for Customer Data and Authorized Users. Customer agrees to promptly
   notify Architect.io of any unauthorized access to Authorized User accounts of which Customer
   becomes aware. Customer has exclusive control and responsibility for determining what data
   Customer submits to the SaaS Service, for obtaining all necessary consents and permissions for
   submission of Customer Data and processing instructions to Architect.io, and for the accuracy,
   quality and legality of Customer Data. Customer is further responsible for the acts and omissions
   of Authorized Users in connection with this Agreement, for all use of the SaaS Service by
   Authorized Users, and for any breach of this Agreement by Authorized Users. Customer will use
   reasonable measures to prevent and will promptly notify Architect.io of any known or suspected
   unauthorized use of Authorized User access credentials.
4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.
   1. Ownership. The SaaS Service and Documentation, all copies and portions thereof, and all
      Intellectual Property Rights therein, including, but not limited to derivative works
      therefrom, are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Architect.io notwithstanding
      any other provision in this Agreement. Customer is not authorized to use (and will not permit
      any third party to use) the SaaS Service, Documentation or any portion thereof except as
      expressly authorized by this Agreement.
   2. License to Customer Data. Customer grants Architect.io a worldwide, non-exclusive license to
      host, copy, process, transmit and display Customer Data as reasonably necessary for
      Architect.io to provide the SaaS Service in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to this
      limited license, as between Customer and Architect.io, Customer owns all right, title and
      interest, including all related Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Customer Data.
   3. Use of Aggregate Information. Architect.io may collect and aggregate data derived from the
      operation of the SaaS Service (“Aggregated Data”), and Architect.io may use such Aggregated
      Data for purposes of operating Architect.io’s business, monitoring performance of the SaaS
      Service, and/or improving the SaaS Service; provided, that Architect.io’s use of Aggregated
      Data does not reveal any Customer Data, Customer Confidential Information, or personally
      identifiable information of Authorized Users.
5. TERM; TERMINATION.
   1. Effective Date and Term. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date. Unless earlier
      terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 5, the Agreement will continue through the
      Subscription Term. Unless one party notifies the other more than fifteen (15) days before the
      end of a Subscription Term, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for an additional
      Subscription Term of the same length.
   2. Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
      notice to the other Party: (a) if the other Party breaches or fails to perform or observe any
      material term or condition of this Agreement and such default has not been cured within
      fifteen (15) days after written notice of such default to the other Party; or (b) if the other
      Party (i) terminates or suspends its business, (ii) becomes subject to any insolvency
      proceeding under federal or state statute, (iii) becomes insolvent or subject to direct
      control by a trustee, receiver or similar authority, or (iv) has wound up or liquidated,
      voluntarily or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement will
      result in the termination of all Subscription Terms.
   3. Termination for Convenience; Suspension. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any
      reason or no reason by providing the other party at least fifteen (15) days prior written
      notice. In addition, Architect.io may discontinue or suspend Customer’s access to the SaaS
      Service immediately if Customer has (or Architect.io reasonably suspects that Customer has)
      breached Section 2.2 or infringed Architect.io’s Intellectual Property Rights.
   4. Effect of Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a)
      Architect.io’s obligation to provide Support Services and the SaaS Service will terminate, (b)
      all of Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ rights to use the SaaS Service will terminate, and
      (c) the provisions of Sections 4.3, 6.4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of this Agreement will survive such
      expiration or termination.
   5. Treatment of Customer Data Following Expiration or Termination. Customer agrees that following
      termination of this Agreement, Architect.io may immediately deactivate Customer’s account(s)
      for the SaaS Service, and Architect.io has the right to delete those accounts, including all
      Customer Data, from Architect.io’s site unless legally prohibited. Customer acknowledges and
      agrees that is responsible to retrieve Customer Data from the SaaS Service prior to expiration
      of this Agreement.
6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
   1. By Each Party. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to enter
      into this Agreement and that its respective provision and use of the SaaS Service is in
      compliance with laws applicable to such Party.
   2. Conformity with Documentation. Architect.io warrants that, during the Subscription Term, the
      SaaS Service will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation. In the
      event of a material breach of the foregoing warranty, Customer’s exclusive remedy and
      Architect.io’s entire liability will be for Customer to request Architect.io’s assistance
      through the Support Services, which Architect.io will provide in accordance with its
      obligations under Section 2.3 (“Support Services”).
   3. Malicious Code. Architect.io warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, the SaaS Service is
      free from, and Architect.io will not knowingly introduce, software viruses, worms, Trojan
      horses or other code, files, scripts, or agents intended to do harm.
   4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS. EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6, TO THE
      MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE SAAS SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ARCHITECT.IO MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR
      OTHERWISE, WITH REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SAAS SERVICE, DOCUMENTATION OR SUPPORT SERVICES.
      ARCHITECT.IO SPECIFICALLY AND EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OR
      TRADE, AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
      FURTHER, ARCHITECT.IO DOES NOT WARRANT THE SAAS SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE USE OF
      THE SAAS SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.
7. INDEMNIFICATION.
   1. By Architect.io. Subject to the remainder of this Section 7 and the liability limitations set
      forth in Section 8, Architect.io will: (a) defend Customer against any third party claim that
      the SaaS Service infringes any trademark or copyright of such third party, enforceable in the
      jurisdiction of Customer’s use of the SaaS Service, or misappropriates a trade secret (but
      only to the extent that such misappropriation is not a result of Customer’s actions)
      (“Infringement Claim”); and (b) indemnify Customer against and pay any settlement of such
      Infringement Claim consented to by Architect.io or any damages finally awarded against
      Customer to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction. Architect.io will have no
      obligation and assumes no liability under this Section 7 or otherwise with respect to any
      claim to the extent based on: (a) any modification of the SaaS Service that is not performed
      by or on behalf of Architect.io, or was performed in compliance with Customer’s
      specifications; (b) the combination, operation or use of the SaaS Service with any Customer
      Data or any Customer or third party products, services, hardware, data, content, or business
      processes not provided by Architect.io where there would be no Infringement Claim but for such
      combination; (c) use of the SaaS Service other than in accordance with the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement and the Documentation; or (d) Customer’s or any Authorized User’s
      use of the SaaS Service other than as permitted under this Agreement SaaS Service. THIS
      SECTION 7 STATES CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND ARCHITECT.IO’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR
      ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS OR ACTIONS.
   2. Remedies. Should the SaaS Service become, or in Architect.io’s opinion be likely to become,
      the subject of an Infringement Claim, Architect.io may, at its option (i) procure for Customer
      the right to use the SaaS Service in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify,
      the SaaS Service to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate Customer’s right to use the
      SaaS Service and discontinue the related Support Services.
   3. By Customer. Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Architect.io and its
      Affiliates, and its and their directors, officers, employees, agents and licensors, from and
      against any damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the
      indemnified parties) finally awarded against them in connection with any claim arising from
      (i) Customer’s use of the SaaS Service or (ii) Customer Data ; provided, that Customer will
      have no obligation under this Section 7.3 to the extent the applicable claim arises from
      Architect.io’s breach of this Agreement.
   4. Indemnity Process. Each Party’s indemnification obligations are conditioned on the indemnified
      party: (a) promptly giving written notice of the claim to the indemnifying Party; (b) giving
      the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c)
      providing to the indemnifying Party all available information and assistance in connection
      with the claim, at the indemnifying Party’s request and expense. The indemnified Party may
      participate in the defense of the claim, at the indemnified Party’s sole expense (not subject
      to reimbursement). Neither Party may admit liability for or consent to any judgment or concede
      or settle or compromise any claim unless such admission or concession or settlement or
      compromise includes a full and unconditional release of the other Party from all liabilities
      in respect of such claim.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   1. Damages Exclusion; Liability Cap. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS
      BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE
      OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
      INTERRUPTIONS, LOSS OF DATA, REVENUE, GOODWILL, PRODUCTION, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OR COSTS OF
      PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR
      TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
      SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITY ARISING FROM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7
      (“INDEMNIFICATION”) (FOR WHICH THE LIABILITY LIMITATION IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
      ($100,000) IN THE AGGREGATE), IN NO EVENT WILL ARCHITECT.IO’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY
      ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($10,000). NOTHING IN THIS SECTION
      8.1 WILL BE DEEMED TO LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE,
      FRAUD, OR INFRINGEMENT BY ONE PARTY OF THE OTHER’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
   2. Limitations Fair and Reasonable. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET
      FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS
      AGREEMENT, AND THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, THE ECONOMIC TERMS OF
      THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.
9. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   1. Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means this Agreement, the SaaS Service,
      Architect.io pricing information, Architect.io technical information, Customer Data and any
      other information disclosed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other (“Recipient”) in
      connection with this Agreement that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be
      understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of
      disclosure. Recipient may use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to perform
      Recipient’s obligations or exercise its rights hereunder. Recipient will not disclose, or
      permit to be disclosed, Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third party without
      Discloser’s prior written consent, except that Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential
      Information solely to Recipient’s employees and/or subcontractors who have a need to know and
      who are bound in writing to keep such information confidential pursuant to confidentiality
      agreements consistent with this Agreement. Recipient agrees to exercise due care in protecting
      Discloser’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure, and in any case
      will not use less than the degree of care a reasonable person would use. The foregoing will
      not apply to any information that: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was
      communicated to the Recipient by the Discloser; (b) entered the public domain subsequent to
      the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the Discloser through no fault of the
      Recipient; (c) was in the Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the
      time it was communicated to the Recipient by the Discloser; (d) was rightfully communicated to
      the Recipient free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated
      to the Recipient by the Discloser; (e) it was developed by employees or agents of the
      Recipient independently of and without reference to any information communicated to the
      Recipient by the Discloser; or (f) is expressly permitted to be disclosed pursuant to the
      terms of this Agreement.
   2. Compelled Disclosure. The Recipient will not be in violation of Section 9.1 regarding a
      disclosure that was in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body,
      provided that the Recipient provides the Discloser with prior written notice of such
      disclosure in order to permit the Discloser to seek confidential treatment of such
      information.
   3. Feedback. To the extent Customer provides any suggestions, recommendations or other feedback
      specifically relating to the SaaS Service or Support Services (collectively, “Feedback”),
      Customer grants to Architect.io a royalty free, fully paid, sub-licensable, transferable
      (notwithstanding Section 10.1 (“Assignment”), non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide
      right and license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise exploit Feedback
      (including by incorporation of such Feedback into the SaaS Service without restrictions).
   4. Sensitive Data. Customer agrees that it will not submit the following types of information to
      the SaaS Service except with Architect.io’s prior written approval: government-issued
      identification numbers, consumer financial account information, credit and payment card
      information, personal health information, or information deemed “sensitive” under applicable
      law (such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or philosophical
      beliefs) or personal data (as described in the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European
      Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
      regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data) of data
      subjects that reside in the European Economic Area (EEA). If Customer wishes to submit any
      such European personal data to the SaaS Service, Customer will notify Architect.io and the
      parties may enter into a separate data processing agreement (including the European
      Commission’s Standard Contract Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors
      established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection) with
      Architect.io prior to submission of such personal data to the SaaS Service. Customer
      represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary consents and permissions from data
      subjects for the submission and processing of personal data in the SaaS Service.
10. GENERAL.
    1. Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior
       written consent of the other Party, provided that no such consent will be required to assign
       this Agreement in its entirety to (i) an Affiliate that is able to satisfy the obligations of
       the assignor under this Agreement or (ii) a successor in interest in connection with a
       merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially of the assigning Party’s assets, provided
       that the assignee has agreed to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement and all fees
       owed to the other Party are paid in full. If Customer is acquired by, sells substantially all
       of its assets to, or undergoes a change of control in a favor of, a direct competitor of
       Architect.io, then Architect.io may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice.
    2. Anti-Corruption. Each Party acknowledges that it is aware of, understands and has complied
       and will comply with, all applicable U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, including without
       limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act.
    3. Notices. Notices to a Party will be sent by first-class mail, overnight courier or prepaid
       post to the address for such Party as identified on the first page of this Agreement and will
       be deemed given seventy-two (72) hours after mailing or upon confirmed delivery or receipt,
       whichever is sooner. Customer will address notices to Architect.io Legal Department, with a
       copy to legalnotices@architect.io. Either Party may from time to time change its address for
       notices under this Section by giving the other Party at least thirty (30) days prior written
       notice of the change in accordance with this Section 10.3.
    4. Non-waiver. Any failure of either Party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other
       Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under
       this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such
       Party’s right to assert or rely upon such provision, right or remedy in that or any other
       instance.
    5. Governing Jurisdiction of the Laws of Massachusetts. Massachusetts law governs these Terms,
       as well as any claim, cause of action or dispute that might arise between you and
       NeighborSchools, without regard to conflict of law or choice of law rules. We make no
       representation that our Website and/or Services are appropriate, legal or available for use
       in locations outside of the United States. If you choose to access our Website and/or use the
       Services you agree to do so subject to the laws of Massachusetts and the United States.
    6. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law by a court of competent jurisdiction, it will be replaced with the valid
       provision that most closely reflects the intent of the Parties and the remaining provisions
       of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
    7. Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as creating an
       agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between the Parties hereto. Neither Party
       has any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations
       or warranties on behalf of any other Party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other
       Party in any respect whatsoever. Each Party may identify the other as a customer or supplier,
       as applicable.
    8. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If the SaaS Service is being licensed by the U.S.
       Government, the SaaS Service is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer
       documentation” developed exclusively at private expense, and (a) if acquired by or on behalf
       of a civilian agency, will be subject solely to the terms of this computer software license
       as specified in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its successors;
       and (b) if acquired by or on behalf of units of the Department of Defense (“DOD”) will be
       subject to the terms of this commercial computer software license as specified in 48 C.F.R.
       227.7202-2, DOD FAR Supplement and its successors.
    9. Export Laws. Each Party will comply with the export laws and regulations of the United States
       and other applicable jurisdictions in providing and using the SaaS Service. Without limiting
       the generality of the foregoing, Customer represents that it is not named on any U.S.
       government denied-party list and will not make the SaaS Service available to any user or
       entity that is located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo, or is
       listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
    10. Entire Agreement; Execution. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between Customer
