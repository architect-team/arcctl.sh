title: Modules
---

Modules are containers for IaC templates that can be executed by Architect. A module consists of a
collection of IaC templates written using one of our supported IaC frameworks. Supported frameworks
include:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/)
- _[CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)_ (coming soon)

## Creating modules

Modules are quite simply infrastructure-as-code resources/modules packaged up as docker containers.
The packaging allows these modules to be published into any docker-supported registry, and allows
Architect to be fully framework agnostic. Even though each module must be composed using a single
IaC framework, datacenters can be constructed with modules that use a variety of different
frameworks.

### Pulumi example

One of the first frameworks we enrolled was Pulumi - an open-source IaC framework that uses your
favorite programming languages to make authoring infrastructure as easy as possible. For the most
part, the file system for a pulumi module will mirror the Pulumi docs exactly. The only difference
is the need for a Dockerfile that helps Architect package the module:

```
|- cluster-module
|--- Dockerfile
|--- index.ts
|--- package.json
|--- pulumi.yaml
|--- tsconfig.json
```

For those unfamiliar with Pulumi, you can check out the example code below which creates a DOKS
cluster in DigitalOcean:

```ts
// index.ts
import * as digitalocean from '@pulumi/digitalocean';
import * as pulumi from '@pulumi/pulumi';

const config = new pulumi.Config();
const vpcId = config.require('vpcId');
const region = config.require('region');
const name = config.require('name');

const cluster = new digitalocean.KubernetesCluster('cluster', {
  name,
  region,
  vpcUuid: vpcId,
  version: '1.27.6-do.0',
  nodePool: {
    name: `${name}-pool-1`,
    size: 's-1vcpu-2gb',
    nodeCount: config.getNumber('node_count') || 3,
  },
});

export const id = cluster.id;
export const kubernetesVersion = cluster.version;
export const kubeconfig = cluster.kubeConfigs[0].rawConfig;
```

Lastly you might be wondering what the Dockerfile looks like to help package this module.
Fortunately, it's quite simple:

```Dockerfile
FROM pulumi/pulumi-nodejs

COPY . .

RUN npm install
```

### OpenTofu

Another framework we currently support is OpenTofu - a fork of the popular framework, Terraform,
which aims to continue the original framework's efforts with a community-driven approach.

:::info

We don't yet support Terraform due to the confusion about what can and can't be done using their new
license. We hope to add support in the future.

:::

Authoring OpenTofu modules has a much simpler filesystem than pulumi modules. All that's needed are
the `*.tf` files themselves. Not even a Dockerfile is needed since there's never any case where the
runtime would need alternative language support. Architect automatically bundles OpenTofu modules
into a docker image w/out the need for a dockerfile.

```
|- vpc-module
|--- main.tf
```

For those unfamiliar with Terraform or OpenTofu, check out the example below which creates an AWS
VPC:

```hcl
variable "name" {
  type = string
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  name = var.name
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = true
}
```

## Using modules

Now that you know how modules are created, we'll show you a bit about how to use them to power your
Architect Datacenters. Modules can be referenced anywhere within a datacenter and will be executed
at the appropriate time accordingly.

In the example below, we've used modules to:

1. Create a single k8s cluster that lives/dies with the lifecycle of the datacenter,
2. Create a namespace that lives/dies with each [environment](./03-environments.mdx) powered by the
   datacenter, and
3. Create a deployment that lives/dies with each deployment [resource](./04-hooks.mdx) deployed to
   the datacenter

```hcl
module "k8s" {
  build = "./k8s-cluster"
  inputs = {
    name = "${datacenter.name}-cluster"
    region = variable.region
    vpcId = module.vpc.id
    "digitalocean:token" = variable.do_token
  }
}

environment {
  module "namespace" {
    build = "./k8s-namespace"
    inputs = {
      name = environment.name
      kubeconfig = module.k8s.kubeconfig
    }
  }

  deployment {
    module "deployment" {
      build = "./k8s-deployment"
      inputs = merge(node.inputs, {
        namespace = module.namespace.id
        kubeconfig = module.k8s.kubeconfig
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### `inputs`

The `inputs` field is the most common field used in Architect modules. It is what allows Architect
to pass information to the modules that's unique to the datacenter, environment, or component.

### `build` / `source`

More often than not, developers will use the `build` field to indicate where on the local filesystem
each module can be built from. Whenever the datacenter gets built, Architect will turn all these
into built and published docker artifacts and reference them in the `source` field.

If you are re-using previously built Architect modules, you can simply reference them wth the
`source` field directly instead of the `build` field.

### `plugin`

By default, Architect assumes that all modules are Pulumi modules - the first IaC framework we
enrolled. However, you can specify that your plugin uses a different framework by specifying the
`plugin` field. For example, if you wanted to use an OpenTofu module, you would specify the `plugin`
field as `opentofu`.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  plugin = "opentofu"
}
```

### `when`

The last field of interest in module invocation is the `when` field which sets a condition under
which the module should be invoked. This is a great way to limit the footprint of your environment
and be reactive to the needs of your developers.
