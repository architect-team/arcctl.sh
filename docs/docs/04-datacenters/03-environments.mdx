title: Environments
---

Of the the key drivers for the creation and adoption of Architect is the desire to offer
self-service to developers. One of the elements of self-service in cloud app development is the
ability to create your own cloud environments. Architect Datacenters offer just the feature needed
to offer this ability while still ensuring that environments behave as desired.

Inside the datacenter file, operators can declare modules that will be invoked once for every
environment the datacenter powers. This is perfect for the creation of namespaces, DNS zones, and
more:

```hcl
environment {
  module "namespace" {
    build = "./k8s-namespace"
    inputs = {
      name = environment.name
      kubeconfig = module.k8s.kubeconfig
    }
  }
}
```

As you may have noticed from the template above, the module invocation includes a dynamic reference
to the environment name that allows the module to include environment-specific information.

In addition to the environment name, modules also have access to the full array of application nodes
that will be deployed to the environment. This metadata can be used to inject environment data into
applications, or include clever conditions that limit when modules should be invoked. The code below
uses the `when` clause to limit the creation of a postgres cluster and nginx controller only to
environments that include a database and ingress node respectively:

```hcl
environment {
  module "postgresCluster" {
    when = contains(environment.nodes.*.type, "database") && contains(environment.nodes.*.inputs.databaseType, "postgres")
    build = "./databaseCluster"
    inputs = {
      name = "${datacenter.name}-database"
      databaseType = "pg"
      databaseVersion = 15
      region = variable.region
      vpcId = module.vpc.id
      "digitalocean:token" = variable.do_token
    }
  }

  module "nginxController" {
    when = contains(environment.nodes.*.type, "ingress")
    build = "./nginx-controller"
    inputs = {
      name = "${datacenter.name}-nginx-controller"
      kubeconfig = module.k8s.kubeconfig
    }
  }
}
```
