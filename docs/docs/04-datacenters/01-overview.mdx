# Datacenters

Creating a strong internal developer platform takes time and experience to do right. Once you create
one golden path, like workflows and IaC templates for a Java monolith, developers quickly ask for
more. They ask for things like microservices, event-driven architecture, ephemeral environments,
logging, observability, and the list just keeps growing. If that wasn't enough, you still have the
other half of your job to do: managing costs, keeping things secure, evaluating tools like gateways,
service meshes, secret managers, and more. That's why we created the Datacenters framework â€“ to help
platform engineers offer the developer benefits of components

Datacenters are packages of configuration and rules dictating how cloud resources should behave.
They allow platform engineers to specify resources that should live inside every cloud environment
to support multi-tenancy (e.g. namespaces, scoped databases, messaging queues, etc), as well rules
for how application resources should behave when they land (e.g. where do secrets get stored, where
should container workloads be run, etc). The ability to codify these rules allows platform teams to
offer true self-service to developers without loosing control of their cloud. Developers can create
their own environments and deploy w/out worrying about infrastructure or workflows, and platform
teams can intrument, monitor, and scale cloud infrastructure w/out worrying about applications or
developers.

## Key features

- Give developers the power to create their own on-demand environments
- Automate zero-trust security for every application (both networking and credentials)
- Experiment with and swap out key tools (like gateways, service meshes, secret managers, and more)
  without needing to coordinate with developers

## State management

Architect uses persisted state to keep track of your accounts, datacenters and environments. These
statefiles represent all of your cloud resources. By default these statefiles are kept on your local
machine. Though, if you want to share these resources with multiple people across machines, then you
will need to use a remote state. Any provider that supports a secret resource type, can be used as a
remote backend.

To configure a remote backend you can run the command, which will run you through creating an
account.

```bash
$ arcctl set state.backend
```

To use arcctl in CI flows you can automate the configuration process. The following is an example of
using DigitalOcean Spaces.

```bash
$ arcctl set state.backend \
  --cred accessKeyId=myAccessKeyId \
  --cred secretAccessKey=mySecretAccessKey \
  --cred endpoint=https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com \
  --cred region=nyc3 \
  --provider s3 \
  --namespace mybucket
```
