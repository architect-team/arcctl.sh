title: State management
description: Store and manage infrastructure state
---

Architect has to store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration in order to
facilitate changes. Architect uses this state to determine which changes need to be made to complete
requests while minimizing impact on the infrastructure.

## Backends

Backends are responsible for storing state and making them accessible to your team and CI agents. By
default, Architect uses a local backend that stores state in a local configuration file, but this is
configurable via the CLI:

```sh
$ arcctl set state.backend
```

### Supported backend types

Architect only supports a couple of different state backends right now, but we welcome contributions
to our [CLI](https://github.com/architect-team/arcctl) to expand our support:

- [x] local - Stores state on the local filesystem
- [x] s3 - Stores state in an S3 bucket on AWS or other conformat providers

## Inspection

State files are simply JSON files containing metadata about the infrastructure or application state,
but editing the contents directly is highly discouraged. If you find yourself needing to debug state
changes, you can export the state of your datacenter or environment using `arcctl show`:

```sh
$ arcctl show datacenter <name>
$ arcctl show environment <name>
```
