title: Apply
---

The final way to create/update environments with Architect is with the `apply` command. This method
takes an entire environment configuration file and treats it as the desired end-state of the
environment. If there are new components or configuration changes, Architect will add/update them.
If there were components in the environment that are no longer in the specific config file, they
will be removed:

```sh
$ arcctl apply environment test ./test-env.yaml
```

## Writing environment files

The environment file is a simply yaml file that includes configuration settings for the environment.
These configuration settings are not meant to override either Components or Datacenters, but are
instead to provide component configuration specific to individual environments (e.g. external API
keys, references to databases that live in each environment, etc).

### Component source

The first and most critical field in the environment config file is the component `source`. This
field tells Architect where the component can be found so it can be pulled into the environment.

There are two ways to refer to a component source:

1. with an component image address (Components get packaged as OCI artifacts and can be
   pushed/pulled to and from any OCI supporting registry), or
2. from the local filesystem. The second option is useful for local debugging of components and will
   trigger a build of all the artifacts necessary for the component.

```yml
components:
  architectio/kratos:
    source: architect/kratos:v1.0
  architectio/twitter-clone:
    source: file:/Users/batman/twitter-clone
```

### Variables

Another important property for components to operate correctly is the `variables` block. This allows
environments to specify different values for component variables like different credentials, log
behavior, etc.

```yml
components:
  architectio/kratos:
    variables:
      log_level: error
```

### Scaling rules

When operating a long-term environment, its important to be able to manage the scaling rules for
each runtime to support the traffic needs of your applications. Architect lets you specify scaling
rules for every deployment in your components with ease:

```yaml
components:
  architectio/kratos:
    deployments:
      kratos:
        replicas: 3
        autoscaling:
          min_replicas: 2
          max_replicas: 4
```

### Environment variables

It is recommended that components be configured using variables rather than overriding environment
variables, but sometimes it can be easier to specify environment variables directly:

```yaml
components:
  architectio/kratos:
    deployments:
      kratos:
        environment:
          LOG_LEVEL: error
```

### Ingress rules

By default, all component ingresses are automatically assigned human-readable, deterministic
subdomains to ensure there are no collisions between ingress routes, but oftentimes teams want to
control the URLs by which their applications are accessed. Developers cna specify specific routing
rules for each ingress in their components right from the environment configuration:

```yml
components:
  architectio/kratos:
    ingresses:
      admin:
        subdomain: kratos
      public:
        subdomain: auth
        path: /api
      auth:
        subdomain: auth
```

### Locals

If there are fields that get re-used throughout the environment, it can be tedious to copy and paste
the value over and over again. Architect offers an easier solution with the `locals` block which
allows you to specify values that can be referenced throughout the environment:

```yml
locals:
  log_level: error

components:
  architectio/kratos:
    variables:
      log_level: ${{ locals.log_level }}
  architectio/twitter-clone:
    variables:
      log_level: ${{ locals.log_level }}
```
