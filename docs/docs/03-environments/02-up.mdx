title: Up
---

The `arcctl up` command is the most popular for developers rapidly making changes to their
Components. It allows developers to quickly spin up test environments for their Components in a
single command:

```bash
$ arcctl up ./ --datacenter local
```

This command will create a completely new environment in the target datacenter, and will keep said
environment active so long as the terminal process remains alive. To kill the environment, press
`Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to send a `SIGINT` signal which will begin environment cleanup.

By default the `up` command will use a random, but human-readable name for the environment, but you
can manually asign a name with the `--environment` flag:

```bash
$ arcctl up ./ --datacenter local --environment my-test-environment
```
