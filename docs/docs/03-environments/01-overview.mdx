Even with a strong separation between application and infrastructure configuration thanks to
Components and Datacenters, the concept of an Environment remains an important element facilitating
collaboration and managing shared configuration. An Environment, which is basically a namespace,
serves as a way for teams to collaborate with one another - teams creating and operating Components
that depend on one another, and Component teams collaborating with the platform teams managing the
Datacenter.

For developers, there are three main ways to interact with an Environment:

- [**up**](./02-up.mdx): The `arcctl up` command allows developers to create ephemeral environments
  that automatically clean themselves up.
- [**deploy**](./03-deploy.mdx): The `arcctl deploy` command adds or updates Component configuration
  in an existing Environment, leaving other Components untouched.
- [**apply**](./04-apply.mdx): The `arcctl apply` command takes in an entire Environment
  configuration and updates the target environment to match said configuration - adding any new
  resources and cleaning up resources that are no longer needed.
