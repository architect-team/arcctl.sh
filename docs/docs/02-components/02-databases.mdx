title: Databases
description: Add databases to your Architect Components
---

Databases represent a common building block in cloud architecture, and Architect makes it easier
than ever for developers to create applications that require databases. Simply declare them as part
of your component and they'll be automatically deployed alongside your applications.

## Creating databases

Ensuring your application has the databases it needs is as simple. Just give them a name, and
specify the type and version of database you need:

```yaml
databases:
  users:
    description: Store user information
    type: postgres:15
  cache:
    description: Cache query results for faster responses
    type: redis:7
```

## Integrating databases

Once you've created your database, it can be easily integrated into your application using
Component's expression syntax:

```yaml
deployments:
  api:
    image: nginx:latest
    environment:
      # You can access the whole connection string
      DB_URL: ${{ databases.users.url }} # postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<db>
      # Or just the individual parts
      DB_PROTOCOL: ${{ databases.users.protocol }}
      DB_HOST: ${{ databases.users.host }}
      DB_PORT: ${{ databases.users.port }}
      DB_USER: ${{ databases.users.username }}
      DB_PASS: ${{ databases.users.password }}
      DB_NAME: ${{ databases.users.database }}
```

## Zero-trust security

One of the perks of treating databases by reference instead of dealing with credentials yourself is
that it allows Architect to infer which applications are accessing each database. This means that
each application can be issued different credentials:

```yaml
deployments:
  auth:
    environment:
      DB_USER: ${{ databases.users.username }} # user-1
      DB_PASS: ${{ databases.users.password }} # secure-pass-1

  payments:
    environment:
      DB_USER: ${{ databases.users.username }} # user-2
      DB_PASS: ${{ databases.users.password }} # secure-pass-2
```

:::caution

Architect sends the metadata necessary to Datacenters so that they can issue unique credentials, but
not all Datacenters choose to do so. If your applications are getting the same credentials, talk to
the team responsible for your Datacenter to learn more.
