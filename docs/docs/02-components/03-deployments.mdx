description: What is a deployment and when do you need one?
---

A deployment is one of the most common resource types used by Components as it almost 1:1 represents
a containerized workload, like an API, webapp, worker, etc. The deployment is responsible for
describing how your applications should be run and configured.

For anyone familiar with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), the syntax of a
deployment will look a lot like
[services](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/), but with two main
differences:

1. The use of [expressions](./09-reference/v2.mdx#expression-options), or pointers, to connect to
   other resources, and
2. The removal of `ports` in favor of the more feature rich [services](./04-services.mdx) block.

The most basic of deployments only require a single field: `image`. The `image` field tells the
deployment what docker image to use to run the application.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: nginx:latest
```

## Building from source code

Architect is primarily a deployment orchestration solution, but we wanted to make it easier to power
dev and test environments by facilitating image builds so that developers can test applications
faster.

To build an image from source as part of a Component, you can use the `builds` block:

```yaml
builds:
  api:
    context: ./api # required
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev # default: Dockerfile

deployments:
  api:
    image: ${{ builds.api.image }}
```

As you can see in the above, you can ensure that your deployments use this new image by referencing
it using Component expressions.

:::info

Whenever Components get built using `arcctl build component`, Architect runs `docker build` on all
artifacts defined in the `builds` block, collects the new image tags, and replaces any references to
`${{ builds.<artifact>.image }}` with the new image tag. You will never see the `builds` block in
compiled Component artifacts.

### Using buildpack

:::caution

Buildpack support is currently an **alpha** feature. While the feature should be stable, it may be
changed without prior notice.

:::

Don't know how to build a Dockerfile? No problem! Architect is uses
[Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) to automatically build containers directly from
source code.

If a Dockerfile isn't found, Architect will automatically attempt to use a suitable buildpack to
produce a functional. If you DO have a Dockerfile but want to test out buildpack anyway, you can
turn it on manually with the `buildpack` flag.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./
      buildpack: true
```

The version of the builder image is `heroku/buildpacks:20`. This builder version only supports
languages such as Java, Go, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Typescript. Learn more about
[Heroku builder](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-builder-images).

Depending on the language that the application is written in, there might be some requirements in
order to build successfully. For example, if an application is written in Java, only these
[supported Java versions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-support#supported-java-versions)
can be used. After selecting a Java version, a `system.properties` might be required at the root of
the application for the builder to use the correct
[Java runtime version](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-support#specifying-a-java-version).

## Environment variables

One of the most common ways to configure cloud applications with unique runtime values is through
environment variables. Environment variables allow an application to receive input unique to the
environment its running in, and are often used for things like credentials and addresses for other
APIs and databases.

```yaml architect.yml
deployments:
  api:
    image: my-api:latest
    environment:
      DB_HOST: rds.amazonwebservices.com/....
      DB_USER: username
      DB_PASS: password
      DB_NAME: my-db
```

Want to learn how to configure values for these variables? Head over to the
[environment docs](../03-environments/04-apply.mdx#variables) to learn how to set values and apply
changes.

## Volumes

On-disk files in a container are ephemeral which means that by default your application loses all
disk data when it crashes or otherwise restarts. Volumes represent disk space that lives outside of
the container runtime that gets mounted to the container when it starts up. By using external
volumes, your data will remain in-tact in the event your service crashes or restarts.

```yaml architect.yml
deployments:
  api:
    image: my-api:latest
    volumes:
      cache:
        description: Volume containing some cached data to speed up API responses
        mount_path: /app/cache
```

## Production readiness

Even though you can run your app locally, there are still a few extra features you can take
advantage of to better prepare your services for production. You're still the expert when it comes
to your application, so you've got to do your part to help out anyone who might run your application
to do so in a safe and cost-effective way.

### Liveness probes

Liveness probes are scripts that get run that to test whether or not your application has booted up
completely and remains healthy. These scripts are often run by container platforms to detect if
services are unhealthy so they can attempt to restart them automatically or route traffic to other
instances.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  main:
    liveness_prove:
      # (required) Command that will be run to check application health
      command: curl --fail localhost:8080/healthz

      # (optional, defaults to 0s) Delays the check from running for the
      # specified amount of time
      initial_delay: 0s

      # (optional, defaults to 30s) The time period in seconds between
      # each health check execution. You may specify between 5 and 300 seconds.
      interval: 30s

      # (optional, defaults to 5s) The time period in seconds to wait for a
      # health check to succeed before it is considered a failure. You may specify
      # between 2 and 60 seconds.
      timeout: 5s

      # (optional, defaults to 1) The number of times to retry a health check before
      # the container is considered healthy.
      success_threshold: 1

      # (optional, defaults to 1) The number of times to retry a failed health check
      # before the container is considered unhealthy. You may specify between 1 and 10 retries.
      failure_threshold: 1
```

### CPU & Memory

The `cpu` and `memory` fields on a component tell container platforms and environment operators how
many resources are needed by a single instance of your service. Providing accurate resource usage
numbers helps operators ensure that costs of each environment are kept low.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  main:
    # (optional) a whole number or decimal that represents the number of vCPUs allocated
    # to each service instance
    cpu: 1

    # (optional) a string representation of the amount of memory to allocate to each
    # instance of the service.
    memory: 2GB
```

### Auto-scaling

Even though the number of replicas to run is an environment-specific decision (e.g. one replica in
preview environments, but several in production), you can help out the operations teams greatly by
codifying your services with the most reasonable metrics to use to trigger auto-scaling.

The scaling metrics below allow you to specify upper thresholds for CPU and memory usage that should
be used to trigger scale-up events and create more replicas of your service.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  main:
    cpu: 1
    memory: 2GB
    scaling:
      metrics:
        # (optional) a number from 1-100 representing a percentage of memory utilization
        memory: 80

        # (optional) a nmber from 1-100 representing a percentage of cpu utilization
        cpu: 70
```

## Debug mode

The nature of deployments is usually to be portable, reusable, and unchanging, but that's only true
when you're done coding. When you're actively working on your applications, you often need to use
specific tools, tactics, or commands to facilitate hot-reloading that you don't need to use once
you're feature complete.

For features like this, Architect deployments and builds support a `debug` block. The `debug` block
allows you to extend the functionality of your service with details that will only be triggered when
a component is being run in debug mode in an environment (e.g. `arcctl deploy --debug` or
`arcctl up`).

```yaml
builds:
  api:
    context: ./api
    debug:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.debug

deployments:
  api:
    image: ${{ builds.api.image }}
    debug:
      command: npm run dev
      volumes:
        src:
          description:
            Mounts the src folder to the container so the application will refresh when I edit my
            code
          mount_path: /app/src
          host_path: ./src
```
