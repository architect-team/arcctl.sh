description: Learn how to setup cronjobs to run with your component
---

There are some scripts and processes that support applications that don't serve traffic and aren't
intended to be run as persistent services. Sometimes developers might need to execute these tasks
manually at their discression, and sometimes they might want them to be run on a schedule.

By defining task definitions inside Architect components, developers can make use of all the same
service discovery and security benefits afforded to persistent services - making it much easier and
safer to execute tasks.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  api:
    # ...

cronjobs:
  run-reports:
    # run every sunday at 3am
    schedule: 0 3 * * 0
    image: my-image:latest
    command: node run-reports.js
    environment:
      API_ADDR: ${{ services.api.url }}
```

The example above will schedule the `run-reports` task to be run every sunday at 3am. The task will
have full access to the api service due to the injection of the service address in the `API_ADDR`
environment variable.

## Configuration options

Cronjobs support almost all of the same configuration options as [deployments](../deployments), but
services cannot target cronjobs like they can deployments. Cronjobs aren't persistent services which
means they can't respond to incoming API requests reliably.

The only field unique to cronjobs is the `schedule` field. This field is a cron string indicating
the schedule at which the task will run. Architect will ensure the cronjobs are instrumented
correctly regardless of where the task is deployed.
