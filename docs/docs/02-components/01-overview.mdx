# Architect Components

For developers, infrastructure and CI/CD is a nuisance. Once it "works on my machine", cloud
applications should be able to run anywhere. Docker and containers have made that true for
application runtimes, but developers still spend too much time writing CI workflows and IaC
templates for the things outside the container. That's why we created the component framework.

Components are application bundles that can be run anywhere and always deploy everything they need
to run. Creating a component doesn't require developers to learn any cloud infrastructure, and
instead focuses on the details they already know about their applications. Details like:

- What database(s) does it need?
- What APIs does it connect to?
- What APIs does it expose?
- What events does it broadcast?
- What events does it listen on?

By cataloging the application's dependencies, Architect is able to guarantee the existance of those
dependencies every time the component is deployed. If they can't be found, Architect will deploy
those too!

## Writing Components

An Architect Component is a collection of cloud resources declared in a single file, usually called
`architect.yml`. The Component framework was modeled after two popular developer tools:
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or any other
package manager). Docker compose provided a great foundation allowing developers to declare what
applications or services they want to deploy, and package managers provided the inspiration for
Architect's own [dependency management](../dependencies) capabilities that allow Components to
connect to one another.

The Component framework is constantly growing to support new application features, but today it
supports several key building blocks:

- [**services**](../services): List the discrete workloads your application needs to run and how
  they communicate with one another
- [**databases**](../databases): Assert what database types and versions your application needs
- [**cronjobs**](../cronjobs): Schedule cronjobs to be run and integrate them with databases and
  services
- [**dependencies**](../dependencies): Connect the services and cronjobs inside your application to
  endpoints exposed by other Components

## Building Components

Like Docker images, Architect Components are get built and pushed to cloud registries so they can be
distributed to individuals and cloud platforms alike. Components are built into OCI-compliant images
that can be pushed into popular artifact registries like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and more.

The workflow for publishing these images also mirrors the workflow for building and pushing docker
images:

### 1. Build

Components can be built using the [`arcctl build component`](/docs/cli/build/components) command as
follows. The build command will compile the component itself as well as any containers that the
application needs to build.

```bash
$ arcctl build component ./component/dir
Digest: 9c3a6c7bccd9
```

### 2. Tag

Once built, Components can be tagged as many times as needed. Tags represent locations where the
artifact can be found once published - kind of like a permalink.

:::info

Tagging only creates a symlink to the digest on your local machine. It does NOT push the image to
any matching registries.

:::

```bash
$ arcctl tag 9c3a6c7bccd9 registry.architect.io/org/component:latest
Tagged: component:test
Deployment Tagged: component:test-deployments-frontend
```

Tagging a Component will also create a tag of any containers that were built from source. The
tagging strategy Architect employs uses the same tag as the component, but with a suffix matching
the container reference within the component. This ensures that the artifacts for the Component and
its corresponding containers all live in the same repository when published.

Tagging can also be done as part of the build command to consolidate workflow steps:

```bash
$ arcctl build component ./component/dir --tag component:latest --tag registry.architect.io/org/component:latest
Component Digest: 477e6db80b4a
Component Tagged: component:latest
Component Tagged: registry.architect.io/org/component:latest
```

### 3. Push

Once you've created your Component tags locally, you can use the push command to ship the artifacts
into a cloud registry:

```bash
$ arcctl push component registry.architect.io/org/component:latest
```

## Deploying Components

Now that you know how to get a Component and its container artifacts into a remote registry, you're
ready to deploy it. Deploying a Component to an existing Environment is as easy as running
`arcctl deploy`, but we'll walk through the full workflow assuming you've never created an
environment before:

### 1. Create your first datacenter

The details of how a datacenter works aren't material to a Component, but you'll still need a
datacenter to back the environments you create. You can learn more about creating Datacenters in the
[Datacenters documentation](/docs/datacenters/overview), or you can use the command below to create
a local datacenter from one of our examples:

```bash
$ arcctl create datacenter local architect-team/local-datacenter:latest
```

The command above will create a datacenter named `local` that we'll use to back our environment.

### 2. Create an environment

Now that we have a datacenter to back our resources, let's create our first environment:

```bash
$ arcctl create environment test1 --datacenter local
```

This will create an environment named `test1` on our `local` datacenter.

### 3. Deploy

Now that we have an environment, we can deploy our Component to it:

```bash
$ arcctl deploy registry.architect.io/org/component:latest --environment test1
```

If your Component exposes any [ingresses](../services/) the URLs will be shown in the logs.

### 4. Cleanup the environment

Congratulations! You've deployed your first component! Now let's clean up the environment so it
doesn't hog any resources unnecessasrily.

```bash
$ arcctl destroy environment test1
```

We're leaving the datacenter up so you can more easily create environments going forward, but if you
want to clean it up you can do so with `arcctl destroy datacenter local`.
