Like [services](./04-services.mdx), ingresses are a way to expose applications. Unlike services
however, ingresses are designed to expose applications to end-users and client applications (e.g.
SPAs, mobile apps, etc). Ingresses are most commonly used for web applications and externally facing
APIs.

The simplest (and most common) ingress definitions only require a service name that traffic should
be forwarded to:

```yml
services:
  backend:
    deployment: backend
    port: 8080

ingresses:
  backend:
    service: backend
```

## Integrating ingresses

One of the key benefits of declaring ingresses alongside components is the ability to integrate with
them from other applications. A client-side web application needs to connect to a backend API in
order to query or write data. By using ingresses, the application can treat said API like a
dependency and integrate with the correct URL in each environment automatically.

To integrate ingresses into deployments, use the Component expression syntax,
`${{ ingresses.<name>.<key> }}`:

```yml
ingresses:
  backend:
    service: backend

deployments:
  frontend:
    environment:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ ingresses.backend.url }}
```

## Private ingresses

Not all applications are meant to be accessed by the general public on the open internet. Some
applications, like internal tools and admin panels, are only meant to be accessed by your own team.

Ingresses can be marked as private indicating that they should be allocated client-accessible
addresses, but should only be resolvable from within the network. This means only team members with
VPN access will be able to resolve them:

```yml
ingresses:
  auth:
    service: auth
    private: true
```

## Custom response headers

Ingresses are often handled by application load balancers - specialized services designed for load
balancing, fast throughput, and basic rules engines so they can route traffic to multiple downstream
services. However, this also means that these applications sometimes need to be configured
separately for CORS to allow traffic through from appropriate client applications.

To accomplish this, ingresses can be annotated with specific response headers that every request to
the ingress will return. These headers can also use the Component expression syntax to reference
dynamic values:

```yml
variables:
  allowed_return_urls:
    description: URLs that the service can safely redirect to after auth flows
    merge: true

ingresses:
  auth:
    service: auth
    headers:
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${{ variables.allowed_return_urls }}
      Access-Control-Allow-Methods: '["GET", "OPTIONS", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]'
      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: '*'
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'
```
