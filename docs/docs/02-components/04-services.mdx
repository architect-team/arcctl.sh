Component Services offer a way for developers to expose their applications to other applications
within the same environment. A key benefit of defining services as part of components is that they
offer a consistent way for applications to integrate with one another without having to learn
unfamiliar service discovery tools and tactics.

Defining a basic service is easy. All that's needed is a deployment the service will target and a
port the deployment responds to:

```yml
deployments:
  auth:
    # ...

services:
  auth:
    deployment: auth
    port: 8080
```

## Integrating services

Once a service is defined, it can be integrated into other applications with ease. Simply reference
the service using the Component expression syntax, `${{ services.<name>.<key> }}`:

```yml
services:
  auth:
    deployment: auth
    port: 8080

deployments:
  auth:
    # ...
  backend:
    environment:
      AUTH_URL: ${{ services.auth.url }}
```

## External services

Sometimes it's necessary to create virtual services. This can be useful to aid with cloud migration
or to enable egress to specific services from within secure environments.

Virtual services can be defined by specifying an existing URL for the service instead of a target
deployment and port:

```yml
services:
  auth:
    url: https://auth.example.com

deployments:
  backend:
    environment:
      AUTH_URL: ${{ services.auth.url }}
```
