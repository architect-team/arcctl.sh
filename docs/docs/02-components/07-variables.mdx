title: Variables
description: Define variables that should be injected into your component at deploy-time

Architect helps automate a huge chunk of application configuration by injecting the addresses and
details of other components and services, but there are still many cases where you'd need to provide
critical values manually like credentials for external services.

Architect makes it easy for component authors to declare the variables their application needs by
using `variables`:

```yaml
variables:
  my_key:
    default: default-value
    description: My description
    required: false
```

## Merging values

By default, values for variables are intended to be provided manually by the developer who deploy's
the component. However, there are some cases where we want to collect variable values from upstream
components (e.g. components that cite this ones as a dependency) instead. To enable this, variables
can be annotated with the `merge` flag indicating that values provided from each source should be
merged together in an array.

A good example of this is collecting a list of allowed return URLs to prevent XSS attacks. Upstream
applications can provide one or more values for the variable when they declare the component:

```yaml
# architect/backend component
variables:
  allowed_return_urls:
    description: URLs that the service can safely redirect to after auth flows
    merge: true

ingresses:
  auth:
    service: auth
    headers:
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${{ variables.allowed_return_urls }}
      Access-Control-Allow-Methods: '["GET", "OPTIONS", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]'
      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: '*'
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: 'true'

# architect/frontend component
ingresses:
  app:
    service: app

dependencies:
  backend:
    component: architect/backend
    variables:
      allowed_return_urls:
        - ${{ ingresses.app.url }}
```
